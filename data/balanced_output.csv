"The findings from this systematic review highlight that EPA and DHA have differential effects on some cardiometabolic risk factors and that, to some degree, this effect is dependent on the study population. Both EPA and DHA are effective at lowering triglycerides, although there is evidence that DHA may lower triglycerides more than EPA. Whilst neither omega-3 PUFA alters total cholesterol to a great degree, DHA appears to increase HDL cholesterol, particularly the more cardioprotective HDL 2 subfraction, whilst EPA decreases HDL 3 cholesterol. DHA increases LDL cholesterol more than EPA, and more so in men than in women, and also increases LDL particle size, which may be less atherogenic. From the more limited trial **data** available, DHA may be more effective than EPA at lowering heart rate and blood pressure in normotensive individuals, whilst both EPA and DHA inhibited platelet function but had no effect on fibrinolytic function. Whilst inconsistent findings were reported for the effects of EPA and DHA on inflammatory markers and glycaemic control, both omega-3 PUFAs were able to lower oxidative stress, which is increased in certain subjects such as diabetics thereby increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease.",yes

"Similar findings have been recently obtained by Garcia-Muniesa [57], who analyzed **data** from a large-scale survey conducted in nine European countries (including Italy). Results demonstrate that having personally suffered worsened economic conditions during the global financial crisis of 2008 was associated with greater support for progressive taxation only for citizens whose economic prospects for the future had become pessimistic. Conversely, citizens who considered that the economic shock they had experienced in 2008 was temporary and were optimistic about the economic situation in the near future did not show support for progressive taxation. Overall, these findings show that only people who feel deprived and believe that things will get worse support redistribution, probably because they expect to benefit the most from redistributive policies.",maybe

"This study contributes to the body of knowledge in three aspects. Firstly, the proposed methods can also be applied to other regions, especially when the **data** of construction waste are insufficient. Secondly, this study not only estimated the carbon emission of recycling activities (environmental cost) but considered the equivalent amount of carbon emissions generated from alternative materials (environmental benefit), which is more in line with practice. The research outcomes would more clearly reveal the environmental benefits generated by construction waste recycling. Thirdly, this study estimated the total carbon emission of construction waste recycling in Shanghai from 2022 to 2031. Obtaining such **data** would help decision makers to set up more scientific management strategies and the action plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030 from the aspect of improving the recycling rate of construction waste and usage rate of recycled materials, which could further contribute to the achievement of China's 2060 carbon neutral goal by focusing on one of the most important economic regions: Shanghai City. However, this study has three main limitations. The first limitation is the assumptions. For example, the production of mortar waste recycling is not ignored, thereby affecting the accuracy of the results. The second limitation is that only the construction waste generated from new construction activities are quantified in this research. If other types of waste, such as demolition waste, construction clay and mud, are considered, then the carbon emission will be higher. The third one is that this study does not compare the outcomes with other disposals, such as traditional landfill practice. If such comparisons can be done, then it could provide decision makers with a clearer understanding of the carbon-saving potential generated from recycling construction waste. Despite research limitations, the results can still provide regulatory authorities with theoretical methods and **data** to establish strategies and policies on promoting waste recycling and cutting down on CO 2 emissions.

"Middle to middle-Late Pleistocene environmental **data** comes from further afield than Flores, namely Java to the west.

By around 135 ka, around the date of the Timor stegodon, annual precipitation on Java is estimated to have been much lower than today (Van der Kaars & Dam, 1995;Van der Kaars & Dam, 1997). Nevertheless, by around 126-81 ka, very warm and humid conditions returned, as did the rainforests (Van der Kaars & Dam, 1995;Van der Kaars & Dam, 1997;Westaway et al., 2007).

"It is worth noting that the presence of the SARS - CoV-2 has also been demonstrated in the urine of SARS - CoV-2 infected patients ( Holshue et al . , 2020;Wang et al . , 2020b;Wang et al . , 2020c ) . The virus was more stable in urine than in the stool . The infectious virus was detectable for up to 3 days in the urine of two adult COVID-19 patients and after 4 days in the urine of one child . In turn , the SARS - CoV-1 retained infectivity in a urine sample for 5 ( 21 - 25 ° C ) ( Duan et al . , 2003 ) to 17 days ( 20 ° C ) ( Wang et al . , 2005 ) . None of these studies reported a period of complete virus inactivation . More and more authors show the presence of SARS - CoV-2 in urine , but the incidence of this phenomenon is low , and its significance from a clinical point of view is probably low ( Peng et al . , 2020;Liu et al . , 2020aLiu et al . , , 2020bYoon et al . , 2020 ) . The presence of the virus in the urine is not necessarily an indicator of infectious particles in this material . The infectivity of the viral particles can be assessed using in vitro tests on cell culture ( Sun et al . , 2020;Zhang et al . , 2020d;Wang et al . , 2020c;Xiao et al . , 2020b ) . Sun et al .

"parameterized by Θ 2 . Researchers have found that fusing different kind of n - gram language models together ( Goodman ( 2001 ) , Mikolov et al . ( 2011 ) ) often significantly improves performance . Table 1 shows the perplexity 3 of 4 - gram and NNLMs on a standard split of the Penn Treebank data set ( Marcus et al . ( 1993 ) ) . Interpolation of a NNLM with a 4 - gram LM gives a 16.9 % reduction in perplexity over a single NNLM even though the two LMs have relatively close perplexities . We use the correlation coefficient between the posterior probabilities of the predicted word over the test set from the two models as a simple measure to predict whether the models are diverse . If the posterior probabilities are highly correlated , then the models are less diverse and smaller gains are expected from fusion . The posteriors from the N - gram and NNLM have a correlation coefficient of 0.869 which is significantly lower than the correlation coefficient of 0.988 for a pair of randomly initialized NNLMs . This higher diversity of the NNLM and N - gram LM combination results in significant perplexity improvement upon interpolation .",maybe
"To compare our findings to observations , we extract the following characteristics from the computed spectra : ( i ) the ratio of the integrated redward over the integrated blueward flux ( L red /L blue ) -which is a measure of the asymmetry of the line shape ; ( ii ) the flux at ' draught ' between the peaks ( F valley ) in comparison to the flux at the maximum point ( F peak ) , which , in practice , quantifies the ' deepness ' of the draught of the double peaked spectra ; and ( iii ) the position of the red emission peak ( v red ) . We show the evolution of these measures in Fig . 3 from t = 40 to 100 Myr ( in intervals of 10 Myr ) with the last data point marked with a square . We compare this to observations of nearby , star - forming galaxies ( the ' Green Peas ' ; data taken from Yang et al . 2016 , also Henry et al . 2015 , and to z ∼ 2 − 3 Lyman - α selected galaxies ( Erb et al . 2014 ) . In addition , we also display other simulation results presented in Walch et al . ( 2015 ) , Gatto et al . ( 2017 ) , and Peters et al . ( 2017 ) ( shown as black circles in Fig . 3 ) . These hydrodynamical simulations include supernovae feedback with random SN positions and cover SN rates from 5 to 45 Myr −1 with none including CRs ( but partially include stellar wind and UV feedback ) . We show them only to support the case that the spectral shape we obtain for the ' noCR ' simulation is not an outlier -but in fact typical for hydrodynamical simulations containing thermal feedback . Fig . 3 shows that all the simulations without CRs produce Lyα spectra with significant flux at line center ( F valley 0.4F peak ; see also the left panel of Fig . 1 ) . This flux is reduced significantly from t 30 Myr in the CR simulations as the outflow is established . Also the asymmetry of the line is increased leading to L red /L blue ∼ 2 . Both measures are more in line with what is found in observations where mostly F valley /F peak 0.1 and L red /L blue 2.5 ( see also Steidel et al . 2010;Kulas et al . 2012 ) . Determining F valley observationally requires a high spectral resolution since the convolution of the true spectrum with the instrument 's kernel leads to a spreading of the peak flux , and thus , the true value of F valley can be even lower than measured . This effect makes our comparison of F valley /F peak conservative and the true discrepancy between the ' noCR ' simulation and the observations might be even larger .",yes

"To further demonstrate the performance of psRNATarget in analyzing miRNA - mRNA interactions in non - Arabidopsis species , we analyzed another benchmark dataset , referred to as rice miRNA - mRNA interaction data , which was collected from the supplemental data ( the additional file 8) of the paper published by Srivastava et al . ( 8) . The new psRNATarget was able to recall much more validated miRNA - mRNA interactions without significantly increasing the total predictions when searching the same rice miRNAs in the rice miRNA - mRNA interaction data against the same rice transcript library , JGI rice Phytozome 12 genome annotation . Specifically , the recall rate was estimated at 82.7 % by the psRNATarget * The comparison was performed between 65 unique miRNAs / ta - siRNAs in the benchmark dataset ( Supplementary Table S1 ) and the Arabidopsis TAIR10 transcripts . Maximum expectation was set to 5.0 and the maximum number of allowed top targets for each miRNA was set to 200 for both scoring schemas . 2017 release compared with the 62.5 % recall rate by the psRNATarget 2011 release ( Table 2 ) , validating the new psRNATarget 's improved performance in analyzing both Arabidopsis and non - Arabidopsis miRNA - mRNA interactions . Using our Arabidopsis benchmark dataset , prediction performances were also compared between the new psR - NATarget and the standalone pipeline , TargetFinder ( 19 ) . Both applications delivered similar ' recall rate ' and total predictions when we chose to balance the ' recall rate ' and precision through adjusting score cutoff ( Supplementary   Table S3 ) . However , if we chose to maximize ' recall rate ' to cover more validated interactions , the new psRNATarget will recall slightly more validated interactions and report much less total predictions , which in turn indicate much higher precision ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . We further compared performances between new psRNATarget and the TAPIR ( 20 ) using its fast mode since the hybrid mode stringently restricts the size of data that can be analyzed each time due to slow computational speed of the algorithm . We noticed that ' recall rate ' of TAPIR is significantly lower than the other two applications even after we adjusted the cutoff thresholds to maximize the ' recall rate . ' However , TAPIR generated much less predictions than the psRNATarget 2017 release and TargetFinder did , indicating higher prediction precision ( Supplementary Table S3 ) .",maybe

"Another important point concerns the bulk sensitivity of the CeRu2Si2 ARPES **data** of Ref. [18]. These spectra were not measured at the high photon energies that enhance bulk sensitivity and which are generally necessary [23] for bulk sensitive Ce 4f studies. However it was found [18,78] that some cleaved surfaces yield 4f spectra at low photon energies, e.g. in RESPES at the Ce 4d edge, that are essentially the same as those at high photon energy, e.g. RESPES at the Ce 3d edge. Such surfaces were used to obtain the **data** of Ref. [18]. The explanation [83] probably lies in the particular crystal structure of CeRu2Si2, which admits of two cleavages, one that exposes Ce at the top layer and another that places Ce in a buried layer. The latter situation is expected to enable bulk sensitive studies even at lower photon energies.",maybe

This may potentially undercount detours since some peers in same AS may see different detours. After selecting a representative we are left with 36 (out of 79) peers. We now continue our characterization of detours by looking at detour dynamics. Specifically we focus on flap rate and duty cycle, defined as follows:",maybe

"The street used as a reference had very few anomalies, was recently paved, and was mostly flat in all its extensions. ""Transmisiones"" street is located in front of a section of the Tecnologico de Monterrey-Mexico City campus. Therefore, it was a suitable candidate because it contained the aforementioned characteristics, and its proximity to the campus is a great advantage. In this whole street, we found three uneven drains, several speed bumps, and one steep curve; therefore, these were the labeled anomalies and were used as a reference in the training and classification of the visualization system. The Figure 5 shows a satellite view of the street. ""Transmisiones"" street was traveled multiple times in order to read all the elements and anomalies in the street; eight unique physical anomalies were identified in the 0.7 km route, as seen in Figure 5. The pavement anomalies were detected at three different approximate average speeds: 20, 25, and 30 km per hour. Two access points were installed along the route, since we controlled the traveled and always measured within the coverage area; **data** acquisition was guaranteed along the route.",maybe

However, as we discussed throughout the paper, creating a training dataset is a considerable challenge in its own right. It requires a combination of human effort, automated extraction of feature values and pre-processing of extracted material using various AI technologies such as clustering and sentiment analysis.

"Artificially misaligned **data** is more similar to a different performance than to a symbolic score; however, for most of MIR applications, such misaligned **data** is enough to cover both training and evaluation needs. To achieve an even more accurate evaluation, in this work we also applied a singlelinkage clustering to the onsets of each misaligned score. We stopped the agglomerative procedure when a certain minimum distance t among clusters was reached. We have randomly chosen such threshold in [0.03, 0.07] seconds, representing broad interval around 0.05 seconds that is assumed as upper-bound of usual chord asynchronies [3]. Subsequently, we set the onsets of the notes in each cluster equal to the average onset time of that cluster so that the final misaligned note sequence contains chords made by notes having the same onset. This is a crucial difference between scores and performance data, in which chords are played with light asynchronies between same-onset notes.",maybe
"Bugs. Researchers using GrimoireLab become dependent on it producing **data** correctly. This makes their studies subject to bugs or errors in GrimoireLab or its configuration. Experience shows that it is more likely that a single researcher writing code makes mistakes causing bugs, than a software used in many different scenarios by many different people. GrimoireLab uses unit testing to prevent new bugs and regressions, with relatively high test coverage (Graal: 99%, Perceval: 98%, SortingHat: 93%, GrimoireELK: 82%, Mordred: 63%). But still, if there are bugs in some component, those could cause wrong **data** to entire datasets. Therefore, **data** checking should still be an important part of any research using GrimoireLab. Adaptability. If a study is designed as a function of what can be done with GrimoireLab, or what can be done easily with it, there is a risk of focusing on what the toolset can do, and being limited by it. Researchers should confront the GrimoireLab model, designing new components when needed, or realizing when it is not well suited for a certain kind of study. Evolution and poor documentation. Even when GrimoireLab features extensive documentation, including a tutorial, and specific documentation for modules, it is not always easy to know what it can do, or how to tailor it to specific needs. This, together with the fact that GrimoireLab is for now a moving target, continuously evolving, may make it complex to use in some cases. Its community is already working on improving documentation, and keeping it updated, but still this may be an issue.",maybe

"The most prominent issues raised concerned **data** and metadata: availability, accessibility, usability, interoperability, resolution, format and quality. Additionally, the importance of sharing **data** and knowledge (i.e. methodological guidance and research results) was repeatedly raised by respondents, emphasising the need to develop not only technologies and RIs, but also strong, collaborative and proactive networking at different levels. Adaptation more than mitigation was confirmed to be a priority for Africa. Beside the scientific and technical aspects, the solution to most of the constraints could be a comprehensive approach able to consider not only scientific and ecological issues but also socio-economic dynamics (land tenure, urbanisation, jobs opportunities, market, prices, investments, etc), which may influence the success and the long-term sustainability of a RI network. Science alone is not always enough, thus mediation among scientists, traditional leaders and agriculture  extension officers could help in facing some of the crucial practical aspects towards implementation. A coherent and thorough analysis and prioritisation of all these issues can therefore help in developing a range of options suitable for specific 'on field' conditions (at national or regional levels). Among the possible options, the developed countries' approach for an RI network on GHG observations was recognised as not being directly applicable to Africa, for different reasons, of which the most important are: high costs for implementation and maintenance, lack of qualified personnel and specialised companies, problems with energy supply, accessibility and protection of field sites, and challenging eco-climatic conditions.",maybe

"Each of the items in enriched indexes stores **data** about a single commit, issue report, code review, message, etc. For example, for a commit, 54 different fields are stored (see Fig. 9 for a more complete description of some of them 2 ), including, among others: author_uuid (unique author identified, provided by SortingHat), author_date (author date in the commit record), files (number of files touched by this commit), lines_added (number of lines added), lines_removed (number of lines removed), message (commit message), project (project to which the repository is assigned), branches (list of branches in which the commit appears). Enriched items are not normalized due to limitations of Elasticsearch, which does not support table (index) join. This has some impact on the size of the indexes (some fields are repeated once and again, when they could be in a separate table, with cross-references). However, the impact is not large, since those fields tend to be relatively small compared with the whole size of the item. The main impact of this lack of normalization is observed when one of those fields changes, and all items with the old value have to be modified. For example, if the name of an author was wrong, and is fixed, all the items authored for that person need to be fixed. For each of the **data** sources supported, one or more enriched indexes are produced, aimed to have useful **data** to produce the metrics that are finally visualized, or used to produce reports.

"However, learning long-term treatment effects is very challenging in practice, since long-term outcomes are often observed only after a long delay. This is especially a problem for randomized experiments, because experiments usually have relatively short durations due to cost considerations. For example, industry online controlled experiments (i.e., A/B testing) usually last for only a few weeks, so practitioners commonly recognize the inference of long-term effects as a top challenge [Gupta et al., 2019]. In contrast, observational **data** are often easier and cheaper to acquire, so they are more likely to include long-term outcome observations. Nevertheless, observational **data** are very susceptible to unmeasured confounding, which can lead to severely biased treatment effect estimates. Therefore, long-term causal inference is very challenging with only a single type of data, either due to missing long-term outcome (in experimental data) or unmeasured confounding (in observational data).",maybe

"We analyzed separately both earthquake and shots data. For the shot database we started with the Cube stations. These stations save the **data** in binary daily files that should be then converted to an appropriate format. The GFZ Potsdam institute provides useful algorithms to convert Cube format to MiniSeed format. During the recorded period, many of the 80 stations deployed lost the GPS signal sometimes, leading to more than one daily file. We found out that the registered **data** had some gaps, meaning that for certain periods of time the station did not register. The most probable cause of this is the loss of GPS signal. Fortunately, MiniSeed files are written with an absolute scale of time, thus, allowing us to identified and exclude these gaps. Another step we performed was to convert MiniSeed into SAC in order to choose the more suitable type file to work with. On the other hand SAC files have the time information not in absolute values but in a single time vector from 1 to the end of samples. Therefore, gaps could not be well identified using this type of files. For this reason we decided to work directly with the MiniSeed data. To reduce computation time we transformed the **data** into .mat format taking only the pieces of signal we needed. Indeed, we cut the signal 30 s before that **data** and 60 s after each shot. When we find a gap in the registration, the shots occurred in that period were not taken into account for that station.",maybe

"Generating the sequence using a preferential attachment based model . We apply a preferential attachment based model to generated topic tuple sequences with power - law distributed usage of each topic tuple [ 32,37,38 ] . In the model , an individual 's activity is randomly chosen from the two actions . One is to explore a new subject and publish a paper with a new topic tuple . The other is to return to a previously studied subject and publish a paper with a topic tuple already used . The probability to explore is defined as ρn −γ in which the term n −γ captures the decreasing trend to explore a new subject as the number of papers increases . Consequently the probability of return , i.e. to reuse an old topic tuple , is 1 − ρn −γ . If one returns , the choice of existing topic tuples is governed by preferential attachment : the probability p i to use a specific topic tuple i is proportional to the tuple i 's current usage , so p i = n i / j n j where n i is the number of times that the tuple i is used . The parameters applied are ρ = 0.4 and γ = 0.1 . Each individual 's time step is controlled by the number of papers published , following distribution P ( n ) ∼ n −1.5 with a cutoff n max = 150 .

"Dataset We train and evaluate our model using the publicly available SAIL route instruction data collected by MacMahon et al . [ 20 ] . The dataset contains 706 non - trivial navigational instruction paragraphs , produced by six instructors for 126 unique start and end position pairs spread evenly across three virtual worlds . These instructions are segmented into individual sentences and paired with an action sequence [ 6 ] . Table 1 presents the corpus statistics with standard deviation in parentheses . Training Details We follow the same procedure as Chen and Mooney [ 6 ] , training with the segmented data and testing on both single - and multi - sentence versions . We train our models using three - fold cross - validation based on the three maps . In each fold , we retain one map as test and partition the two - map training data into training ( 90 % ) and validation ( 10 % ) sets , the latter of which is used to tune hyperparameters . We retain the data for the third map as the test set . We repeat this process for each of the three folds and report ( size - weighted ) average test results over these folds . We later refer to this training procedure as "" vDev . "" Additionally , some previous methods ( p.c . ) adopted a slightly different training strategy whereby each fold trains on two maps and uses the test map to decide on the stopping iteration . In order to compare against these methods , we also train a separate version of our model in this way , which we refer to as "" vTest . """,yes

"DNA sequence analysis . Genomic DNA was isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines of the patient , the healthy sibling and the parents . WGS was performed at Complete Genomics Inc. 6 ( CG ) using their standard sequencing pipeline , version 2.0.2.26 . For further analysis only small variants ( single - nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions , deletions and block substitutions ) from the CG ' var ' file were considered , which reports variants compared with the reference genome ( NCBI build 37.2 ) up to a length of about 50 nucleotides . CGAtools ( CG Analysis Tools ) version 1.5 was used as provided by CG ( http://cgatools.sourceforge.net ) for subsequent analysis . With an in - house WGS analysis pipeline , we searched for recessive , compound heterozygous and de novo variants ( Fig . 2 ) . First , we combined all variants from all genomes of every family member into the union of variants using the CGAtools listvariant command and CG ' var ' files as input . Then , we used the CGAtools testvariant command to test each genome for the presence of each allele at every variant position . We next applied the following filtering steps : ( 1 ) we removed variants that were not called in at least one genome as high - quality calls ( VQHIGH ) by CG . ( 2 ) Next , we filtered for rare variants having a minor allele frequency equal or smaller than 1 % in the European American population of the 1000genomes project 36 and the NHLBI ESP exomes ( https://esp.gs.washington.edu ) , as well as in the control data set CG69 provided by CG . ( 3 ) Variants were filtered out , for which in the index patient both alleles were called reference . If one or both alleles of the index patient were not called , the variant was not filtered out at this stage . ( 4 ) When applying a recessive inheritance model , we filtered for variants that were either called homozygous in the index patient and not in the unaffected sibling and heterozygous in the parents or compound heterozygous allowing for no call alleles . Here we filtered for two different heterozygous variants within the same gene coming from different parental genomes and both not present in the unaffected sibling . ( 5 ) Variants were annotated using ANNOVAR 37 using the NCBI RefSeq Release 60 and Ensembl Release 74 genome annotations . Only exonic variants were kept that were annotated as non - synonymous , frameshift insertion / deletion , nonframeshift insertion / deletion / substitution , stop gain , stop loss and variants disrupting splice sites up to two bases into intron or exon . The remaining variants were then assessed using SIFT 38 , Polyphen 39 , MutationTaster 40 and CADD 41 for pathogenicity . Ingenuity Variant Analysis ( Qiagen ) and the Family Genomics Workflow ( familygenomics.systemsbiology.net/software ) provided independent candidate lists , and were used for confirmation of the primary analysis . Wholeexome sequencing was performed after enrichment with SureSelect Human All Exon Kit ( Agilent ) targeting B38 Mb , and sequenced on one lane of an Illumina GAIIx instrument using a paired - end sequencing protocol . To detect and evaluate SNVs and small indels , reads were mapped to the GRCh37 reference genome ( hg19 ) by the Burrows - Wheeler Aligner 42 . Subsequently , SNVs and small indels were called using SAMtools 43 and VarScan 44 . The resulting list of variants was annotated with ANNOVAR .

"Validation of the classifications was performed on the dataset for the test. For this, statistical metrics were used to evaluate and test the performance of the adjusted CNN. The metrics are specified in Table 3, of which are calculated according to the results of the classifications. The Kappa index is a measure of agreement used in nominal scales that gives us an idea of how far the observations deviate from those expected, at random, thus indicating to us how legitimate the interpretations are. It measures the percentage of the **data** values on the main diagonal of the table and then adjusts these values for the amount of agreement that might be expected [50]. Accuracy is an index that reflects the rate at which individuals are correctly classified into the category containing their true score. Ranking accuracy is usually attributed to the appropriateness and validity of your decisions based on the obtained score. A large value for the index indicates a high hit rate of individuals in the correct categories, and a low value indicates a lower rate of correct classification of individuals [51].

"In the case of the signal process , top quarks are produced more abundantly relative to their antiquark partners due to the charge asymmetry of the W boson radiated from the initial - state quark in pp collisions at the LHC . This leads to a higher relative background contamination in the l − final state arising from top antiquark decay compared to the l + final state from top quark decay , as shown in Fig . 7 . As a result , the measurement in the l − final state is more sensitive to the sources that significantly alter the background contributions along with the signal , compared to the ones that impact the signal contribution only . This is reflected in Table 3 where the uncertainties from the signal modeling are lower for the l − case ; whereas other sources , except for the ones listed under flavor - dependent JES , that alter the background contributions along with the signal have a larger impact on the total uncertainty . In the case of the flavor - dependent Table 3 : Summary of the m t uncertainties in GeV for each final - state lepton charge configuration . The statistical uncertainties are obtained by performing the fits again in each case while fixing the nuisance parameters to their estimated values from data .

The amount of statistical fluctuations in the systematic shifts are quoted within parentheses whenever alternative simulated samples with systematic variations have been used . These are determined from 1000 pseudo - experiments in each case . Entries with < 0.01 denote that the magnitude of the systematic bias is less than 0.01 .",no

"To test whether detected associations may be explained by the selfselection of families into greener neighborhoods , a series of adjusted models were fit to the data . First , controls for children 's genetics were entered using the educational - attainment polygenic score . We have previously shown that , in the full E - Risk sample , children with higher educational - attainment polygenic scores exhibit greater overall IQ at age 5 ( r = 0.14 , 95%CI : 0.09 , 0.19 , p < .001 ) ( Wertz et al . , 2018 ) .

"Indeed, we were able to ascertain the year of birth of three dead babies found in a deep-freezer to within 1-2 years (1986, 1988 and 2004, respectively), using the method. In spite of this evident success of the method there was one aspect of the **data** that represents a puzzle. The 14 C levels of the lenses were consistently smaller than those of the nails, corresponding to apparent later formation of the lenses (Figure 15). In fact the idea of combining (averaging) the 14 C **data** of nails and lenses is not supported by the data, i.e. the hypotheses that the nails and lenses are formed at the same time is less than 5% probable.

"To measure the ω(O − C) 2 values, given in Table 4, we have re-analyzed the **data** of Feast (1954) and Andersen (1975). This showed that the **data** of Andersen (1975) and those of our paper have similar quality while those of Feast (1954) have clearly lower quality, as already emphasised by Andersen (1975). For this reason, we omitted Feast's **data** in the remaining of this paper. We combined the newly obtained radial-velocity values ( Table 2) with those previously obtained by Anderson (1975). This gave a total of 62 radial-velocity values for each of the components to which we assigned equal weights. As can be seen in Table 4, we find an offset in average velocity V 0 between the two radial-velocity sets. This could be due to the difference in used spectral lines in the two studies, but it may also be that we find a downward trend in V 0 over time due to the presence of a third body. We have too few epochs to model any V 0 trend for the time being.

"SKA continuum surveys at low frequencies (< 1 GHz) should be ideal to probe the cosmic radio dipole already in the Early Science phase for two reasons. First, it is not necessary to cover the full area of the 3π surveys, since a sparse sampling spread out over all of the accessible sky should be sufficient for a first estimate. And second, a focus on low frequencies and bright sources will pick primarily AGNs which have a much higher mean redshift than the SFG. Figure 1 illustrates the accuracy that we can hope to achieve for a measurement of the radio dipole based on a linear estimator (Crawford 2009;Rubart & Schwarz 2013). Our estimates are based on differential number counts from surveys in small and deep fields and simulations (Wilman et al. 2008). Our expectations for all-sky continuum surveys are summarized in Table 1. We find that the cosmic radio dipole can be measured at high statistical significance, even taking realistic **data** cuts into account (e.g. masking the galaxy and very bright extragalactic sources, or morphology, spectral index or flux cuts).",no

"The **data** collected from immunoprecipitation studies using mpkCCD 14 and HEK cells, combined with the results from GST pulldown assays strongly infers that AQP2 interacts with 14-3-3 and -. Furthermore, these selective 14-3-3 interactions being phosphorylation-dependent are supported by 1) an increased interaction of AQP2 with 14-3-3 following dDAVP treatment in a time scale where AQP2 phosphorylation is known to occur; 2) phosphatase inhibitors potentiating the dDAVP-induced AQP2/14-3-3 interactions; 3) a loss of AQP2 in GST pulldowns following -phosphatase treatment of prey lysates; 4) reduced AQP2/14-3-3 interactions in various AQP2 phosphorylation-deficient mutants; and 5) direct interaction of only Ser(P)-256 peptides with immobilized 14-3-3. Overlay assays and SPR analysis provided evidence that a direct 14-3-3/ AQP2 interaction was possible, which was critically dependent on Ser-256 phosphorylation. However, as 14-3-3 is known to associate with other proteins that can interact with AQP2, e.g. AKAP, Nedd4-2, Hsp70, BiP, ␤-actin, tropomyosin, PKA, and PP1 (46 -48), we cannot rule out that other proteins are involved in, or possibly stabilize the interaction, as part of a multiprotein complex. Interestingly, the interaction of AQP2 with 14-3-3 and -differs to other 14-3-3 membrane protein interactions observed in the kidney, e.g. the sodium hydrogen exchanger NHE1 association with 14-3-3␤ (49) and the UT-A urea transporter association with 14-3-3␥ (13), providing additional evidence that 14-3-3 isoforms are not redundant but rather play selective roles in modulating protein function.",no

A more intriguing find involves measurements of γ in the T=0 limit in Ba(Fe 0.92 Co 0.08 ) 2 As 2 ( T c = 20 K ) [ 131 ] and BaFe 2 ( As 0.7 P 0.3 ) 2 ( T c = 30 K ) [ 132 ] , both of which report a sizeable residual contribution in the SC state that is ~20 % of the estimated normal state electronic contribution . This anomalous residual term is similar in nature to that observed in YBCO [ 133 ] and CeCoIn 5 [ 134 ] , both well - established to have nodal OP symmetry . However , the field dependence of γ in both FeSC systems does not follow the behavior expected to go along with nodal excitations , such as the well - known H 1/2",no
"In this section we study the simplest non-abelian case, corresponding to two M5-branes wrapped on S 2 , or equivalently we study the reduction of the 5d U (2) theory to 4d on an interval with Nahm pole boundary conditions. The flat 4d theory is given by a map into the 2-monopole moduli space M 2 , with the action given in (4.30). For the curved space theory we find a description in terms of a sigma-model into S 1 × R ≥0 supplemented by self-dual two-forms obeying some constraints.

"The simplest possibility for the dark energy component is cosmological constant Λ or equivalently vacuum energy [6]. In the past, a nonzero cosmological constant has been advocated and then with the improved observational **data** discarded several times [7]. Due to this checked history and the difficulty in understanding the observed Λ in the framework of modern quantum field theory, now most physicists and astronomers prefer other candidates for dark energy, including a frustrated network of topological defects such as strings or walls [8] and an evolving scalar field referred to by some as quintessence [9] etc. As shown in literatures, it is difficult to discriminate against these different possibilities either by the SNeIa **data** alone [10] or only by the CMBR **data** [11]. This led some authors to consider the combination of the SNeIa measurements with the anisotropy of CMBR [12] or the large scale structures [13].",no
"3.2.7. Solid waste dumping in the drainage system. There is no field level or survey **data** for Bharatpur regarding reduced depth of drainage due to the dumping of solid waste in the existing canals. Considering the rapid population growth in Bharatpur, it is assumed that the decrease in depth due to the dumping of waste in the canals would be 10 cm in the Pungi and Kerunga system per year (in Sylhet it is between 10 and 20 cm per year and we assumed the lowest effect of 10 cm in the absence of historical records **data** for Bharatpur). Solid waste dumping without any cleaning or dredging operations in the expanded canals and new drains (Sc-2) after five years was simulated under scenario Sc-7. It is estimated that the simulated inundated area is 99 ha. Therefore, the additional area that would get waterlogged is approximately 27 ha more than in scenario Sc-2. A proper solid waste management system was considered under scenarios Sc-2 to Sc-6. The important infrastructural changes in Bharatpur for drainage improvement include: (i) the rehabilitation/ expansion/re-sectioning of the existing drainage system in the Pungi canal; (ii) the construction of new drains in the areas where new development is occurring; and (iii) soft measures for improving solid waste management.

"Protein interactions within the DGC can be categorized as occurring either within or across the plane of the membrane. The SG-SSPN subcomplex and ␤-DG are transmembrane proteins that interact laterally with one another in the sarcolemma. Dystrophin and the DGs provide a structural linkage across the sarcolemma to connect the extracellular matrix with intracellular F-actin (for a review, see Durbeej and Campbell, 2002). We found that SSPN perturbed both types of interactions in SSPN-Tg muscle. We propose that SSPNmediated aggregation of the SGs causes destabilization of ␣-DG attachment to the sarcolemma, which, in turn, leads to perturbation of basement membrane formation (Fig. 10). Taken together, our **data** support a model whereby SSPN overexpression disrupts protein interactions within and across the membrane bilayer (Fig. 10). SSPN expression caused clustering of the SGs into detergent insoluble aggregates, which were never observed in wild-type mice. Non-phenotypic  , 1 m. (B) Electron micrographs were taken at higher magnifications to visualize the basement membrane. The distance between adjacent sarcolemmas is greater in the SSPN-Tg muscle than in the non-Tg muscle (white arrows). The extracellular matrix is visualized as a tight linear structure between two neighboring sarcolemmas in the non-Tg tissue. However, the extracellular matrix is randomly placed in dense, disorganized clumps in the phenotypic SSPN-Tg muscle (black arrows). Bar, 200 nm. SSPN-Tg mice displayed only low levels of SG protein aggregation. We provide **data** to suggest that SSPN overexpression drives formation of SSPN hyper-oligomers within the sarcolemma. We propose that such abnormal SSPN structures disrupt proper SG protein interactions by trapping the SGs into insoluble protein aggregates.",no

"An essential part of the sensor system that requires further elaboration for technically viable point - of - care operation is the pump source .

"Recent developments in analytical methods have introduced jet substructure observables accurate beyond leading-logarithm accuracy. One recent ATLAS publication based on 32.9 fb −1 of √ s = 13 TeV **data** presents a first measurement involving the jet soft-drop mass -one such substructure variable -using dijet events from p-p collisions [38]. The analysis features a reclustering of the constituents of anti−k T jets based on a designated soft-drop mass procedure. This procedure is based on an iterative condition which is governed primarily by the choice of two parameters: z cut and β , which relate to p T and angular thresholds in the context of gluon radiation. The final results correspond to normalized differential cross-section measurements, presented as a function of the logarithm of the dimensionless quantity ρ 2 , where ρ is the ratio of the invariant mass of the jet following the soft-drop procedure and the transverse momentum of the ungroomed jet (ρ = m soft drop /p ungroomed T ). The inclusion of p ungroomed T in the denominator counters an undesireable p T dependence. The distribution shown in Figure 7b, corresponding to the particular choice of β = 0, can be contrasted with other such distributions (for β = 1, 2) in the original publication. An unfolding procedure is used to correct for detector-level effects. The evolution of the distributions with β and z cut highlights particular regions of the quantity log 10 ρ 2 with larger levels of disagreement between **data** and predictions. Such disagreements between the measured **data** and either precise QCD calculations or leading-logorithm Monte Carlo simulations will prove beneficial in improving our understanding of the collinear QCD regime.",no
"Much more remarkable in the figure is qualitative differences between the ONe core and the Fe cores. Among other things, the Fe cores emit a substantial amount of neutrinos from much earlier on than the ONe core. This is simply due to their higher temperatures as mentioned earlier. The electron-positron pairs are more abundant, producing neutrinos copiously. In fact, the ONe core is so cold until the electron capture on Mg is opened that electrons are strongly degenerate and, as a consequence, positrons are scarce, making the neutrino luminosity from the pair annihilation negligibly small. Unfortunately, the plasmon contribution is also tiny as long as the temperature is very low, since only a small amount of plasmons are thermally populated then. It is hence understandable that the neutrino luminosity becomes substantial in the ONe core only after the electron captures and the subsequent burnings of oxygen and silicon heat it up, which occur less than a second before collapse. Even after the formation of the NSE region (T 5 × 10 9 K) inside the core, the number luminosity of the ONe core is much smaller than those of the Fe cores. As a matter of fact, ∼ 10 53 neutrinos are emitted in the 15 M ⊙ model while in the 8.4 M ⊙ model the number of emitted neutrinos is only ∼ 10 51 . Note, however, that the luminosity increases very quickly in the last few hundred milliseconds in the ONe core and It is still increasing rapidly at the end of our calculation. At this point the central density is 10 11 g/cm 3 and no more **data** are available from the stellar evolution calculation. Unlike the Fe cores, the ONe core is rather slowly contracting even at this point, with the NSE region being expanding gradually. We hence expect the luminosity continues to rise further until neutrinos are trapped inside the core, which will be somewhat delayed, since the neutrinos considered here have smaller energies (∼ 5 MeV) than those produced by electron captures during collapse (∼ 10 MeV).",no

"Covariance shift [Shimodaira, 2000], is another relaxation of DA. Here, given an observation, the class distributions are same in the source and target domains, but the marginal **data** distributions are different. P t (Y |X) = P s (Y |X), but P t (X) = P s (X). This situation arise, for example, in active learning, where the P s (X) tend to be biased to lie near the margin of the classifier. At a first glance, this situation appears not to present a problem, since P t (Y |X) = P s (Y |X), which we can estimate from the data. Here is why it becomes a problem in practice. Assuming, first of all, that the model family we use is mismatched to the data, i.e. regardless of what parameter we choose the model won't fit the underlying distribution. Under this assumption, covariate shift becomes a problem for the following reason. The optimal fit of the source **data** will be such that it minimize model error in the dense area of P s (X) (because these areas will dominate the error). Now, since P t (X) is different from P s (X), the learned model will not be optimal for the target **data** (again, since the model family is mismatched).",no

"Two UV lamps were positioned oppositely inside the tube. In a dusty environment, airborne E. coli can be carried by dust particles which prevent UV light from irradiating E. coli. Placing two symmetrical UV lamps can increase the UV irradiance exposure to E. coli. The UV light intensity distribution of one and two UV lamps simulated by UVCalc software is shown in Figure 3. The distributions of UV intensity were not uniform. With one UV lamp installation, the UV fluence rate decreased as the distance away from the UV lamps increased.

The UV fluence rate measurement was validated by the UV light meter at different distances away from the UV lamps. A total of 12 points at different distances were measured for each UV lamp setup. The average fluence rate of the 12 points measurement were 4884 µW cm −2 and 9860 µW cm −2 for one and two UV lamps.

This shows the reliability of the model as the UV light meter has an accuracy of ±5%. In two UV lamp setup, there is a difference of more than 5% compared to the model data. This can be explained by limitations in the measurement process. UV meter sensor can only cover a certain irradiance angle. Therefore, when measuring the UV intensity of two lamps symmetrically positioned on wall, it will not be able to cover the entire incident light, leading to a slight decrease in fluence rate. In one UV lamp setup, the UV meter sensor cover the irradiance angle better than in two UV lamp setup, making a better accuracy rate.  ",no

We performed some preliminary checks , however , to investigate whether we could uncover any obvious correlations with other properties of the loops . Excluding the loop segment where the measured field strength was too high for the weak field approximation to be valid , we found a strong correlation ( r=0.66 ) with the measured temperature , such that higher magnetic field strengths lead to higher loop     were made around the loop , although our sample does cover quite a wide range of loop properties from cooler , denser cases to hotter , more tenuous ones . We also found that a relationship can be established with the loop pressure that extends to the loop segment with the highest field strength ( shown in Figure 4 ) . This segment also has the highest density and lowest temperature , which act to offset each other and allow the loop to follow the same trend as the others and the correlation between the parameters is also strong ( r=0.68 ) . Our initial survey has been limited by the need to select a sample from data taken early in the mission when calibration degradation was minimal . Ongoing progress in improving the EIS calibration will allow a wider study to take advantage of more extensive data ( including flare data ) in the future . This should help to clarify these relationships further . Landi et al . ( 2020 ) estimate the uncertainty in their measurements to be on the order of 70 % -driven by multiple factors such as the cross - calibration between the short - and longwavelength detectors , the density diagnostic ratio , atomic physics parameters , and also the accuracy of the energy separation between the 4 D 5/2 and 4 D 7/2 levels . This includes an estimate of the contribution from the radiometric calibration and sensitivity degradation over time . As discussed , we chose observations from early in the mission to minimize the impact of the time - dependence of the calibration . Based on the Warren et al . ( 2014 ) model , sensitivity loss is minimal ( < 10 % ) for the datasets we use , so this contribution is reduced from 50 % to 24 % . This propagates through to produce an uncertainty in I M IT /I M 2 of 51 % . We adopt this value in Table 1 . Furthermore , the conversion from I M IT /I M 2 to B is not linear ( see Figure 2 ) . To assess the impact of the uncertainties on this conversion , for each loop , we performed a 10000 run Monte - Carlo simulation where we randomly perturbed the I M IT /I M 2 value within a uniform distribution covering the range defined by the 51 % uncertainty . We then take the standard deviation of the magnetic field strength distribution , with the estimated ∼20 % uncertainty in the 4 D 5/2 and 4 D 7/2 energy separation added in quadrature , as our evaluation of the uncertainty in B. These range from 20 - 36 % and are added in Table 1 .",no

"The most significant quantity in all these criticality experiments is the mass of the assembled fissile material in the benchmark assembly when it is close to the criticality point (critical mass). Measured physical parameters (other than nuclear data) that influence determination of the critical mass are the geometry of the fissile material, its isotopic composition and density, the geometry and material composition of the support structure, and characteristics of the surrounding environment. The neutron leakage from cylinders with various geometries is rather sensitive to the energy-angular distribution of neutrons scattered in the benchmark fissile material and less sensitive for geometrically similar spheres. Uncertainties of the physical parameters (e.g., dimensions) for manufactured cylinders of fissile material are much smaller than those for comparable spheres. Criticality measurements are very sensitive to fissile material geometries. Errors in determining benchmark physical parameters, underestimation of their uncertainties, failure to apply required corrections, and deficiencies or simplifications in the models used in simulations can affect the ∆k eff comparisons significantly. The excessive impact of these benchmarks on **data** validation and/or **data** adjustment could be mitigated by considering USU.",no

"To assess the impact of MLC tracking on target coverage and organ-at-risk (OAR) dose, the expected deviation between the planned and delivered dose must be quantified. Several methods have been proposed to compute the delivered dose based on offline dose reconstruction. [15][16][17][18] Recently, we have presented an online dose reconstruction solution for assessment of prostate SBRT, 19 which calculates and accumulates dose in real-time based on dose-influence data, while accounting for the machine/target motion interplay. Dose-influence **data** describe the influence of the fluence distribution on the patient dose. To make this approach applicable to dose calculation, the fluence distribution is subdivided into small rectangular segments, called bixels. Online dose reconstruction provides real-time quality assurance during treatment and provides the means to directly validate the performance of MLC tracking. Moreover, it is a prerequisite for replanning scenarios in which the treatment plan is changed on the fly during delivery. For example, drift motion might result in a gradually changing trade-off between target coverage and OAR dose which can be compensated for during delivery by replanning between beams.",no

"Processes 2021, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 13 In this paper, the focus is on the formalization of expert knowledge and its use for test design and integration into different machine learning (ML) algorithms. The formalization of expert knowledge from different domains (e.g., expertise regarding plant mechanical processes and knowledge about thermo-chemical and other physical mechanisms of chemical processes) is particularly challenging and reveals the uniqueness of the presented approach. Due to the lack of data, deep neuronal networks cannot always be trained, and other ML algorithms must be combined to quantify and expand expert knowledge from different domains. Figure 1 shows the continuous learning procedure and the interaction between the different parts of an AI-based hybrid model, i.e., **data** measurement, expert knowledge, and ML algorithms with special metrics for automated evaluation (autoML) [5]. With this procedure, expert knowledge can be continuously quantified, and the understanding of the plant and chemical processes can be expanded. Along with a cloud-based IT solution from Engineering Data Intelligence (EDI Ltd., Pfinztal-Berghausen, Germany) called the ""EDI hive Internet of things (IoT) Framework"" (short EDI hive), the process of capturing expert knowledge and the integration of process engineering fundamentals, AI-based modeling, and the subsequent application of the AIbased hybrid model in power plant operation can be achieved.

"In summary , we have developed DiLFM , an algorithmenhanced LFM technique that can substantially reduce reconstruction artifacts and maintain high contrast without any hardware modification even in extremely noisy conditions . To optimize the performance of the proposed DiLFM , we thoroughly discuss the appearance and mechanism of three different kinds of LFM reconstruction artifacts and intake them all into a dictionary patching model to correct them . Furthermore , the proposed dictionary patching increases the reconstruction resolution and contrast by supplying high - resolution and high - contrast information from the training stage . We validate our DiLFM through In the functional imaging experiment , we show DiLFM can discover two times more neurons with improved ΔF / F and reduced artifacts disturbance with low light dosage . We hope the scheme can help LFM become a promising and reliable tool for high - speed imaging biological tissues in 3D. The proposed DiLFM achieves superior performance compared to traditional LFM but with full advantages of LFM in other aspects . For example , the volume acquisition rate of DiLFM is independent of the size of the sample and only limited by camera frame rate , compared to other 3D imaging technology . Introducing the dictionary only affects the downstream data processing speed without any sacrifice of capturing rate . It is straightforward to extend DiLFM to a larger FOV or a compact head - mounted LFM 27 . Furthermore , by introducing photon - scattering models into dictionary priors 34 , it is possible to exceed the depthpenetration limitation of DiLFM in in vivo mouse - brain imaging 23 . Borrowing the thoughts from DiLFM of using the versatile dictionary to adopt different imaging environments , other deconvolution energized volumetric imaging methods 22,35 can also use such a prior for better performance in various applications .",no
"In D'Angelo et al. [28] and in Audrito et al. [29], the authors study the bandwidth constraint problem. This concerns flow on multi-interface networks. In these papers, each interface is associated with a specific bandwidth. The Maximum Flow and Minimum Cost Flow problems aim at finding a connection between two nodes by considering the bandwidth constraints. The Maximum Flow problem aims at maximising the bandwidth between the two nodes. All the network interfaces are assumed to be active. In this way all the permitted connections can be established. In this context, a flow function that guarantees the maximum communication bandwidth between the two nodes has been studied. This problem is a generalisation of the Maximum Flow problem for standard networks. The Minimum Cost Flow problem aims at finding a communication sub-network between two nodes that has a minimum energy consumption cost and ensures at least a given communication bandwidth B. More precisely, the problem finds the set of active interfaces that has minimum cost and ensures that a certain node s can exchange **data** with another node t with a bandwidth not smaller than B. Although the solution can be a path between s and t, a more complex graph can be required. This has nodes with active interfaces that depend on the network topology.

"Loss re-weighting Apart from the aforementioned databased re-balance strategies, another line of studies propose to mitigate the negative effects of **data** imbalance by modifying the loss functions. Loss re-weighting is one of the simple but effective ways to tailor the loss function for imbalanced classification, where the basic idea is to upweight the tailed samples and downweight the head samples in the loss function [17]. The existing solutions differ mainly in how to define the weights for different classes. In classsensitive cross-entropy loss [14], the weight assigned to each class is inversely proportional to the number of samples. In class-balanced loss [7], the authors decide the re-weighting coefficients based on the real volumes of different classes, named effective numbers. In the work [30], the weights to the training examples are optimized to minimize the loss of a held-out evaluation set.",no

"We conclude to have found evidence of periodic line-profile variability in the primary and secondary of CV Vel with a period between 5.7 and 6.4 days. This is almost equal to the orbital period. Moreover, the quoted frequency error is a formal 1σ leastsquares error, and is an underestimation of the true error given that we covered less than two full cycles with unblended Mg II lines. It therefore seems that line-profile variability occurs with a period very close or equal to the orbital one. This is potentially interesting as it could point towards the excitation of a tidally induced g-mode oscillation in the components. However, given the phase relation we obtained, and the absence of any periodic signature in < v 2 >, it is more likely that a reflection and/or variable limb-darkening effect lies at the origin of the detected variability. We need a more extensive **data** set to firmly establish the correct interpretation of CV Vel's line-profile variability.",no
"Response: It is possible to measure the shell length of dead snails. However, comparing those measures to the size of snails that survived all the way to the end is problematic because the time period they were able to grow is different. Thus, the size of snails that died during the treatments could appear smaller even if their growth rate was the same when compared to individuals that survived to the end. This is the reason why we did not measure the size of snails that died. Further studies could follow snail growth over time with high resolution to get estimates of their growth trajectories.

"The determinism test, which is based on a correct reconstruction of the attractor, enables us to measure average directional vectors in the coarse-grained embedding space [19]. The embedding space should be coarse-grained into equally sized boxes. Each pass of the trajectory through the th box can be regarded as a unit vector , and their directions are approximated by the points where the particular pass enters and leaves the box. Their average directional vector of the unit vector through the th box is defined by
= 1 ∑ =1 ,(7)
where is the total of all passes in box . Therefore, an approximate direction for the vector field can be obtained by all occupied boxes. If the **data** set sources from a deterministic dynamic process as well as a fine enough coarse-grained partitioning, the vector inside one box would nearly not cross. Since each crossing will decrease the size of the average vector , the average length of all directional vectors will be 1 for a deterministic process, while for a random process it will be 0. In order to verify whether the studied sway is from a stationarity process, stationarity test is evaluated [16,20]. To perform this method, the time series (20000 points) is divided into ℎ (ℎ = 100) short nonoverlapping segments; therefore, a cross-prediction error ( ) statistic is calculated for ℎ 2 possible combinations. We obtain a very sensitive statistic capable of detecting minute changes in dynamics and thus a very powerful probe for stationarity. If of each combination is not much larger than the average, the examined time series can be considered to be from a stationary system.",no
"The development of mesoscale circulation depends on the length scale of the land heterogeneity. Mesoscale circulation is sensitive to spatial scale and is typically generated at scales of 10-100 km 16,41 . To investigate the sensitivity of cloud inhibition effect induced by mesoscale circulation to spatial scale, we reestimated ΔCloud using MODIS cloud **data** resampled to different spatial resolutions. We find that with reduced resolutions of cloud data, the spatial coverage of cloud inhibition shrinks from~37% at 0.05°to~24-28% at 1°, while cloud enhancement becomes more dominant (from 63% to~76-72%) (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 2).

"We correct for leading-track misidentification with a data-driven procedure. Starting from the measured distributions, for each event the track loss due to inefficiency is applied a second time to the **data** (having been applied the first time naturally by the detector) by rejecting tracks randomly. If the leading track is considered reconstructed it is used as before to define the different regions. Otherwise the sub-leading track is used. Since the tracking inefficiency is quite small (about 20%) applying it on the reconstructed **data** a second time does not alter the results significantly. To verify this statement we compared our results with a two step procedure. In this case the inefficiency is applied two times on measured data, half of its value at a time. The correction factor obtained in this way is compatible with the one step procedure. Furthermore, the data-driven procedure has been tested on simulated **data** where the true leading particle is known.

"The novel biomarker ki:e SB-C was systematically evaluated to determine fit for purpose by following the V3 framework. One important aspect and strength of digital biomarkers in general, and ki:e SB-C in particular, is automation. Speech **data** can be easily collected by telephone or by mobile front-ends face-to-face, and ki:e SB-C can be reliably calculated using the proprietary automatic speech analysis pipeline. Verification step of this study revealed that the automatic speech processing pipeline, including speech recognition, performs at an acceptable level across different languages and tasks, and therefore, automatic processing works reliably for the purposes of  the biomarker. The aim of the analytical validation was threefold: to evaluate (1) the ki:e SB-C against a cognitive gold standard measure (MMSE), (2) the biomarker's retest reliability, and (3) how well ki:e SB-C reflects agerelated -but clinically not relevant -changes. The results of the analytical validation analyses revealed that ki:e SB-C was a valid biomarker to measure cognitive abilities that are relevant for the target population, as seen by its high correlation with MMSE scores even if corrected for the effect of age. Furthermore, the automatically calculated biomarker was stable in retesting as assessed by a test-retest analysis. It is well established that aging is a risk factor for cognitive decline and diseases [26]; however, not all changes are pathological. It is important for a biomarker that is a surrogate for cognition to reflect subtle changes that are at a subclinical level. Our results showed that ki:e SB-C can detect age-related changes in cognitive function. These changes are also reflected in MMSE scores as a trend. Regarding the direct comparison with the MMSE on the healthy DeepSpA population, the SB-C seems to vary more marked by a larger standard deviation (regarding the mean) as compared to the MMSE. This might be also due to the fact that the SB-C is a more fine-grained measure as compared to the MMSE, which might especially in the healthy population lack the resolution to measure cognitive changes at this higher functioning level and would elicit less variance.",no

The strength of these contrasting cloud effects (i.e., cloud enhancement and inhibition) follows a latitudinal dependency with the largest magnitude in the tropical regions and diminished toward higher latitudes (Fig. 1b). This is likely due to preferential conditions for convection development at low latitudes, as indicated by their high convective available potential energy, which decreases at higher latitudes 27 . Our additional sensitivity tests indicate that the global pattern of ΔCloud holds when estimated using alternative window sizes ( Supplementary Fig. 2) and split time periods (2002-2007, 2008-2013, 2014-2018, Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting the robustness of results to scale of a local window and interannual variability of cloud cover.",no

"A formal perturbation equation describing the genotypephenotype relationship was proposed ( 48 ) to compute the fitness effect , or Evolutionary Action ( EA ) , of mutations .

EA quantified the likely functional impact of individual mutations on par or better than other methods in blind and objective assessments ( 49 ) , and also helped in the interpretation of exome data ( 50 ) , ignoring any interaction effects .

"The effect of the push pulse can thus be summarised as projecting the 2 1 Agwavefunction into a manifold of spatially separated triplet-pairs by using an optical perturbation that selectively couples the triplet-pair amplitudes of the 2 1 Agwavefunction to the 1 (TT)* excited states, and their decay pathways towards nearly-free entangled triplet-pairs. Not only does this show how triplet-pairs can be harvested with low energy photons from non-luminescent polymers, it also provides a type of analysis of the total triplet character in the many-body 2 1 Agstate, as well as the possibility to study real-time, real-space triplet motion in an organic material. In fact, as ultrafast time-resolved microscopy is rapidly emerging as a viable experimental techniques 80 , it may even become possible in the near future to observe and manipulate the individual triplets in the nearly-free pairs.

"The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr **data** of the modern vegetation and archaeological bone reflect the diversity of the geological settings in the Catalan central coast and central depression. The samples originated from the main geological areas around Turó de la Font de la Canya and provide a first overview of the strontium isotopic ranges from the vicinity of the site to 130 Km away to the West. The sampling of the Pleistocene sediments of the Vallès-Penedès valley proved challenging due to the high degree of human impact in this area, which prevented us to collect reliable samples. The strontium results from the large majority of the archaeological samples (27 out of  neighbouring Garraf mountains indicates that livestock was present in this coastal mountain area during the first millennium BC [62][63][64][65]. Interestingly, the strontium results obtained so far at Turó de la Font de la Canya suggest that this human community did not pasture its sheep and goats on the Garraf or other neighbouring mountains on a regular basis. Only six teeth out of the 34 analysed have a strontium signature compatible with that of the Cretaceous limestones of the Garraf, despite their proximity (circa 4 km as the crow flies). Overall, the limited variability of strontium ratios points towards local rearing of caprines rather than longdistance trade of animals. The homogeneity of the strontium results contrast with the diversity of imports recovered from the site, which include Cruz del Negro pottery from the Straits of Gibraltar, Tanit figurines of Punic origin, a clay mask from the central or eastern Mediterranean, and numerous Campanian A ceramics from Italy in the levels dated from the 4 th and 3 rd centuries BC among others [20][21][22]. While the possibility cannot be excluded that the sheep and goats analysed originated from other areas with similar geology, the homogeneity of tooth values in a fairly large sample argues against this. It seems, therefore, that sheep and goats were mainly bred locally, and only 'prestige' goods (e.g. Phoenician wine, Greek pottery) arrived from distant sources.",no

"The **data** structure that was generated by simply applying the concepts was not premeditated. In summary, this resulted from the spatial differences between material boundary operations (i.e. those enclosing several distinct occupiable spaces at once, those circumscribing one occupiable space discretely, and those specifying a characteristic persisting for only part of a circumscription of a discrete occupiable space), and the necessarily particular relations of each occupiable space to its outside (consisting of other bounded occupiable spaces). It turned out that **data** identification according to elementary boundary operations as experienced from the human perspective of one side of the boundary and then the other, initially produces further disaggregation into units.

"First, what appears to be a truncation is not necessarily truncated. The features could be intentionally constructed, i.e. actually preserved and originally finished that way. This is arguably the most important distinction: do we see the representation of the finished article thanks to decent preservation or is the shape of this feature a representation of something broken? If the latter, there are still many options. Was the feature destroyed and, if so, when, by whom, and how? Did it deteriorate over time and, if so, by gradual dilapidation of the original feature after disuse or due to other site formation processes? Was it damaged by modification, reuse, or reappropriation in the ancient or recent past? Did it suffer from decay of perishable building materials or decay due to the perishing of originally incorporated natural elements (such as trees and plants)? Was (part of) the feature removed by either animals or humans after disuse or abandonment? Without a symbology for line ends, when conditions of archaeological recording allow for it, the end user will once again rely on rules of thumb to carry out the conjectures. Fortunately this can be done in critical and archaeologically knowledgeable and sensible ways (see Vis, under review, 2014b). Once the metadata of the project as well as spatial **data** and analogous information from historic and cultural proximity have been exhausted, one can still apply visual and morphological contrast when constructing complementary data, document the applied rules of thumb, and mark up **data** for easy separation of these conjectures from retentions of originally acquired spatial data.",no

"Previous reports have consistently shown that tau seeds can be transported into lysosomes after neuronal internalization (15,18,62) and some linked lysosomal dysfunction to Tau aggregation (26,63). Our lab has previously shown that internalized tau aggregates can result in the subsequent rupture of unidentified vesicles in neurons (14), enabling tau seeds to promote tau aggregation in the cytosol. Now, our present work identified the lysosomal delivery of Tau seeds as a key step in the process of seeded Tau aggregation. Based on our **data** we hypothesize that by reducing the transport of tau seeds into lysosomes via PIKfyve inhibition, tau seeding can be halted. In line with this idea it has been recently shown that exosomes containing Tau seeds require transport into the lysosome as well as lysosomal rupture to promote Tau aggregation (64). Whereas tau-seeds-induced rupture of lysosomes has not been shown yet, other protein oligomers such as α-synuclein fibrils are known to induce rupture of the lysosomal compartment and induce seeding (65).",no
"Mixed methods were used for **data** collection. The qualitative **data** collection was carried out first, making use of semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs). A total of 26 semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight livestock owners, four shepherds, and a further five with livestock owners' wives, and five with shepherd wives.

Four semi-structured interviews were conducted with health workers, one with a male nurse, another with a physician and two with veterinarians. Eight FGD were conducted with six people per group. Three focus groups were organised with sedentary livestock owners, whilst two discussion groups involved transhumant pastoralists, and participants of the three other FGD comprised respectively herdsmen, livestock owners' wives and herdsmen' wives.

"Turning to our primary dependent variable, namely support for redistribution policies aimed at redressing wealth and income inequalities, our hypothesis was that participants' demand for redistribution through progressive taxation would be greater if they were in a collective mind-set and felt relatively economically disadvantaged.

In both studies results revealed a significant interaction between manipulated socio-economic status and mind-set, showing that a personal vs. collective mind-set was irrelevant for participants led to feel relatively well-off. Conversely, mind-set played an important role for those led to feel economically disadvantaged: only participants in the low socio-economic status condition indeed proposed higher progressive taxation when in a collective than in a personal mind-set (see also pooled **data** analysis).

"The issue of self medication was addressed by Henquet and colleagues , 6 using data from the German prospective early developmental stages of psychopathology study . 12 13 The authors investigated the association between cannabis use at baseline and subsequent development of psychotic symptoms at four year follow - up and reported that after adjustment for pre - existing psychotic symptoms , cannabis use at baseline still remained significantly associated with psychotic symptoms at follow - up . There was no evidence of an effect of self medication as pre - existing psychotic symptoms did not significantly predict later cannabis use . 6 Ferdinand and co - workers investigated the role of pre - existing self reported psychotic symptoms and showed a bi - directional association between cannabis and psychotic symptoms over a 14 year follow - up study in the general population . 11 They showed that cannabis use predicted later psychotic symptoms in individuals with no evidence of psychotic symptoms before starting to use cannabis and that the reverse was also true , in that psychotic symptoms predicted cannabis use in those who had not used cannabis before the onset of those symptoms . 11 A prospective population based cohort study also found evidence for a self medication effect . 14 Individuals with self reported hallucinations at the age of 14 had a higher risk of using cannabis on a daily basis at the age of 21 .

However , the distance between the respective distributions as calculated by the 25th/75th metric varied significantly among the different assays ( BacR > BacHum > BacCow > BoBac > BacH ) . The large differences observed highlight the necessity to pay attention to quantitative aspects of source - specificity when trying to assess the performance and applicability of such MST assays .

"interventions targeting positive affect could have potential in mitigating pathological processes associated with cognitive and functional decline through increasing flexible and adaptive responses (e.g. thought-action repertoires) to environmental demands and/or optimizing cerebral glucose metabolism within these particular brain regions. Of course, this is highly speculative, and warrants examination with more sophisticated modeling techniques and measures to further clarify the causal relationships between these variables.

First, because over half the participants in this study have a family history of AD (66.9%), were late middleaged (m ¼ 59.29 yrs-old), highly educated (m ¼ 16.97 yrs) and predominantly Caucasian (97.0%), the generalizability of our results is limited and would benefit from replication in more diverse samples. Second, while we included a measure of perceived health, which has been shown to attenuate the association between happiness and all-cause mortality (Liu et al., 2016), we did not examine a variety of specific psychological (e.g. personality, coping style), health (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine, exercise) and social factors (e.g. social stress and support, income) that may be associated with positive affect (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). Lastly, we speculate based on the literature regarding possible connectivity between regions, thus future analyses employing connectivity methods for FDG-PET **data** would be useful.",no

"Impairment in consciousness and cognition can occur in the setting of a primary neurologic disease (e.g., hypoxicischemic, hemorrhagic, or traumatic brain injury), or as a consequence of a systemic insult (e.g., toxic, metabolic, and/or infectious processes). Invariably, an interplay of multiple factors concurrently contributes to the development of encephalopathy. As a result, predicting the short-and long-term consequences of impaired consciousness and cognition remains a challenge, in which the self-fulfilling prophecy bias of premature pessimistic outcome predictions plays an important role [75,76]. Key disease-specific knowledge gaps in neuroprognostication have been recently unveiled in a joint statement from the German Neurocritical Care Society and the Neurocritical Care Society [77]; future studies should account for these limitations. Population-derived disease severity scores are incorrectly used to ascertain long-term individual prognostic trajectories. Further, these scores are not dynamic and are frequently inaccurate. Accurate neuroprognostication is crucial to guide critical care resource allocation and to guide families in goals of care discussions; thus, it is imperative to improve tools for prognostication in neurocritically ill patients. cEEG monitoring provides dynamic information on brain physiology, and it can be used as a noninvasive biomarker that correlates with level of consciousness [78] and neurological recovery [79]. Machine learning has been demonstrated to be a promising tool to analyze EEG **data** and unveil patients with preserved awareness by means of electroencephalographic activation in patients with acute brain injury [78]. This state known as ""cognitive motor dissociation"" was previously demonstrated in chronically unresponsive patients [80], and more recently in acute brain injury [78,81]. Similarly, the use of machine learning and quantitative analysis of longitudinal EEG signals shows promise in improving accuracy of commonly employed neurophysiologic predictors of outcome after cardiac arrest, such as background reactivity, epileptiform activity, and background continuity [79,82].",no

"Most of the studies published to date refer to DHRS9 as a retinol dehydrogenase based on the previously published reports (16)(17)(18)36). However, as shown in the present study, DHRS9 is much more efficient toward oxylipins with hydroxyl groups at positions 12 and above than toward retinol or androsterone. It also appears that the members of the SDR9C  family have more divergent functions than the members of the SDR16C or SDR7C families, which primarily specialize in the oxidative (SDR16C) or reductive (SDR7C) metabolism of retinoids. Unlike human DHRS9, human RDH16 displayed much lower rates and higher K m values toward oxylipins than toward androsterone. This study utilized the same Sf9 microsomal preparations of SDRs that were previously analyzed for their activity toward all-trans-retinol and 3α-hydroxysteroids as substrates (34). To determine whether there was a loss of activity during storage, the microsomes were retested with saturating concentrations of all-trans-retinol and androsterone. These assays demonstrated that no significant loss of activity had occurred; thus, the catalytic efficiency of SDRs toward C18-C22 polyunsaturated hydroxylipids can be compared with the previously published **data** on all-trans-retinol and androsterone.",no

"Fine epitope mapping using yeast display. The anti-HCV core antigen MAb has been mapped to aa 32 to 36, the anti-HCV NS4 MAb to aa 1697 to 1708, the HCV NS3 cAb to aa 1190 to 1216, and the HCV NS5 cAb to aa 2382 to 2408. To fine map the epitopes, alanine scanning combined with yeast display was used to probe the epitopes at the individual amino acid level. Each amino acid of the epitope fragment was substituted with alanine. For example, HCV NS5 aa 2382 to aa VOL. 17,2010 cAbs AGAINST HCV NS3, NS4, NS5, AND CORE ANTIGENS 1043 2408 had alanine substituted at each position of the epitope, with the exclusion of aa 2382, which was alanine in the wild type.

"HEYL Localization Is Altered in Cancer Tissue-We have previously shown that in prostate cancer biopsies HEY1 expression is predominantly cytoplasmic rather than nuclear, and we hypothesized that this cellular localization provides a growth advantage in cancer cells, circumventing the repressive effects of nuclear HEY1 (25,26). To understand better the mechanism(s) of repression of AR by HEY proteins, we examined the subcellular distribution of HEYL protein by confocal microscopy with a monoclonal antibody. In normal and benign transformed prostate epithelial lines, RWPE-1 and BPH-1, respectively, endogenous HEYL was entirely nuclear (Fig. 7A). In our inducible LNCaP:HEYL cell line treated with doxycycline, the exogenously expressed HEYL was also nuclear, demonstrating that the transfected HEYL behaves similarly to endogenous protein, and furthermore, we observed a co-localization of HEYL and AR in the nucleus of these cells in the presence of androgen (Fig. 7A, bottom panel). In addition, we verified the specificity of the HEYL antibody by immunofluorescence and Western blotting of LNCaP:HEYL cells treated with or without doxycycline (Fig. 7A). To examine expression patterns of endogenous HEYL in human prostate tissue, we used prostate needle biopsies from patients with prostate cancer and stained them for HEYL. As shown in Fig. 7B, endogenous HEYL was expressed in the epithelial cell compartment of the prostate and showed nuclear localization in benign cells (Fig. 7B, left panels) with little expression detected in the cytoplasm. However, in all stages of cancer examined, HEYL nuclear intensity decreased, in most cases correlating with increasing cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 7, B and C). The expression score for each patient is plotted in Fig. 7C. This shows that nuclear expression decreased in all stages of the disease studied but remained high in adjacent benign tissue. Furthermore, expression of HEYL in the cytoplasm remained low in adjacent tissue but at the same level or higher in prostate cancer. Collectively, these **data** suggest that HEYL is excluded from the nuclei of cancer cells but not benign cells, indicating that nuclear exclusion of HEYL occurs in the early stages of prostate cancer formation or progression.",no
"Next, we investigated whether the uptake of K18 PFFs is actin-dependent by inhibiting actin polymerization using Latrunculin A (32). Treatment with Latrunculin A resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in dextran uptake, a bona fide marker for actin-dependent fluid-phase endocytosis. With respect to K18 PFFs uptake and tau aggregation, actin polymerization inhibition clearly resulted in a significant reduction of internalized K18 PFFs (IC 50 = 57 nM) and consequently decreased significantly K18 PFFs-seeded tau aggregation (IC 50 = 25 nM) (Fig. 1, G and H). These **data** contradict previous reports that claim that tau aggregates are internalized by an actin-independent mechanism in iPSC-derived neurons (18), but support **data** from other cell lines (16). Overall, these **data** give further support, but now in primary hippocampal neurons, that internalization of K18 PFFs is governed by a clathrin-independent, but dynamin1-and actin-dependent mechanism. Importantly, we now also link a reduced amount of tau seeds internalization to decreased tau seeding in neurons.",no
"To investigate the ICP27 RNA binding specificity , HSV-1 RNA sequences that interact with ICP27 were first identified . A yeast three hybrid analysis identified 31 HSV-1 sense RNAs , mapping to 28 different open reading frames , which interacted specifically with ICP27 in vivo ( 26 ) . ICP27 was also found to specifically associate with seven HSV-1 RNAs in in vivo UV - crosslinking studies . The late RNA for the glycoprotein C ( gC ) gene was one of the RNAs that UV - cross - linked to ICP27 in infected cells ( 3 ) . To further refine the pools of possible RNA binding sequences , a yeast three - hybrid screen was performed with an RNA library generated from nucleotides 95 155 - 98 129 of the KOS HSV-1 genome , which encompasses two late genes , UL43 and UL44 ( gC ) . Sequences corresponding to both the mRNA coding and noncoding strands from UL43 and gC were identified in the yeast three hybrid screen as interacting with ICP27 ( data not shown ) . No obvious consensus sequences were identified in these sequences ; consequently EMSA was used to screen these sequences for those that bound to ICP27 with high affinity . A 294 - nt region of gC , corresponding to nucleotides 96 946 - 97 239 of the coding strand of the KOS HSV-1 gC mRNA , was chosen as an EMSA binding substrate . This region of the gC mRNA was chosen over the other sequences because it was within the coding region of the gC mRNA and was small enough to screen . Nineteen overlapping 30 - mer DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to coding strand of the gC RNA were used in EMSA experiments ( Figure 1C ) . RGG box motifs in other proteins recognize both RNA and DNA quadruplex structures ( 30,31 ) , so gC DNA was used instead of gC RNA for this initial screening to provide a more stable substrate for analysis . The ICP27 N - terminus was incubated with individual radiolabeled gC DNA 30mers at 37 C and resolved by nondenaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis . Figure 2A shows a gC DNA sequence that the ICP27 N - terminus was able to shift its migration to a more slowly migrating band , gC 11 - 40 , and a second sequence , gC 31 - 60 , whose migration was not affected by addition of protein .

"In rice, all except OsMKK10-1 and OsMKK10-3 are expressed in four reproductive stages from the microarray **data** (Additional file 19). Moreover, all maize and poplar MKK genes are expressed in different tissues (Additional file 19). However, the transcriptional levels in PtMKKs have a great difference, while maize is not obvious (Additional file 19). To further validate the transcripts of B. distachyon MKK genes in different tissues, we tested five different tissues that were a part of Bd21 seedling, root, leaf, stem and young caryopsis, to analyze the tissue specific expression patterns of MKK genes (Additional file 20). The results revealed that all except BdMKK10-4 are expressed in five different tissues and BdMKK6 and BdMKK10-2 have higher transcriptional levels in young caryopsis than other tissues (Additional file 20). It is interesting that previous study show that MKK10 may not be biologically functional on account of the lack part of the phosphorylation site, but OsMKK10-2 can mediate the response to pathogen defense. Not as expected, MPK6 can be phosphorylated by OsMKK10-2 which have the kinase activity [28]. Moreover, we surveyed the gene expression of MKK under abiotic stresses that public microarray **data** of Arabidopsis under wound, drought, genotoxic, cold, osmotic, high-salinity, heat, oxidative and UV-B treatment were collected (Fig. 6d). Many plant MKK genes are up-regulated upon UV-B treatment, including AtMKK4 and AtMKK5. These results indicated that plant MKK genes may be involved in UV-B related signaling. To validate the expression profile of plant MKK genes in UV-B signaling, we performed the RT-qPCR experiments on RNA collected from different time points of B. distachyon plants under UV-B treatments. The results revealed that many MKK genes are up-regulated upon UV-B treatment, including BdMKK4 and BdMKK10-5, especially BdMKK10-5 originally have low-level transcripts in B. distachyon tissue (Additional file 20). These results indicated that BdMKK genes maybe also respond the UV-B stress. In a word, we can speculate that plant MKK genes play potential roles in UV-B related signaling.",no
"The cell recognizes pathogens upon binding of the so-called PAMPs to PRRs. In addition, there is increasing evidence showing that these PRRs also sense endogenous danger signals, known as DAMPs that are released by necrotic cells. 107 The PRR group consists of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NLRs, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and C-type lectin receptors. Depending on the cellular context, PRR triggering can induce different types of cell death. To date, TLR-mediated necrotic cell death has been described in cells triggered by TLR3, -4 and -9. Recognition of dsRNA or poly(I:C) (synthetic dsRNA analog) by TLR3 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by TLR4 triggers the recruitment of an adaptor called Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-b, 108,109 which interacts with both RIPK1 and RIPK3 via its RHIM domain, 110 suggesting the possible involvement of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in TLR3-and TLR4-induced necrosis. Indeed, poly(I:C)-induced necroptotic cell death in the presence of interferon-b is inhibited in RIPK1-deficient cells 111 or when RIPK1 kinase activity is blocked. 24,34 Recently, it has been reported that poly(I:C) stimulation in a steatohepatitis disease model induces necrosis that is correlated with an increase in RIPK3 expression, indicating a possible role for RIPK3 in poly(I:C)induced regulated necrosis in vivo. 112 Triggering TLR4 by LPS prevents necrotic cell death of macrophages when either RIPK1 or RIPK3 is absent by RNA interference-mediated knockdown. 18,113 Together, these **data** suggest that TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation may induce RIPK1-and RIPK3dependent necroptosis (Figure 2b).",no
"In summary, results presented here show a complex transcriptional regulation of the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway in legumes under water-deficit conditions.

"To confirm the results, 740Y-P (a PI3K agonist, Selleck, USA, S7865) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor, Selleck, USA, S1105) were used to treat MNNG cells alone or combined with C 18 H 17 NO 6 for 48 h. Firstly, we found that 740Y-P at 20 µM remarkably increased the proliferation ( Figure 3A     C 18 H 17 NO 6 group (p<0.05). After co-incubation with 740Y-P, these changes were marked rescued (p<0.05). Secondly, the protein expression levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin were evaluated. As shown in Figures  3G and 3H, the protein expression levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, N-cadherin, and Vimentin were significantly downregulated following treatment with 4 µM C 18 H 17 NO 6 (p<0.05). 740Y-P at 20 µM remarkably rescued this decrease (p<0.05). We obtained the opposite results in the protein expression levels of E-cadherin. Finally, to investigate whether the PI3K/AKT pathway participates in the inhibitory effect of C 18 H 17 NO 6 on MNNG cells, the cells were incubated with 740Y-P (20 µM), LY294002 (20 µM) alone, or in combination with C 18 H 17 NO 6 (4 µM) for 48 h. Compared to the control group, 740Y-P at 20 µM remarkably upregulated the protein expression of p-PI3K and p-AKT (p<0.05), and C 18 H 17 NO 6 at 4 µM and LY294002 at 20 µM treatment resulted in remarkably downregulated the protein expression of p-PI3K and p-AKT (p<0.05). After co-incubation with 740Y-P, C 18 H 17 NO 6 -dependent inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was eliminated. Co-incubation with LY294002 enhanced suppression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Figures 3I, 3J).

"The AR is unusual among steroid hormone receptors in that the major transactivation function is activation function-1 (AF1) situated within the N-terminal domain rather than AF2 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is relatively weak in the AR (6,31,33). Furthermore, AF1 can be subdivided into two discrete, overlapping activation domains, the usage of which is context-dependent. Although almost the entire N terminus (residues 1-494) is required for full activity of the full-length receptor, a core that contributes 50% of the activity is located between residues 101 and 360, and this region has been termed TAU1. However, in the absence of the LBD, a different region mediates activation, and this region is termed TAU5 (residues 370 -494) (31) (Fig. 2A). We performed pulldown interaction assays to determine the interaction of full-length HEYL with full-length and deletion constructs of AR. These showed that GST-HEYL was able to interact strongly with full-length AR expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, a robust interaction was also observed between full-length HEYL and GST-NTD, which contains the AR N-terminal domain (residues 1-556) but lacks the LBD and most of the DNA-binding domain (DBD), indicating that HEYL likely interacts with AR via the N-terminal transactivation domain (Fig. 2B). In support of this, no interaction was seen between HEYL and GST fused to the LBD in the presence or absence of ligand. To determine whether HEYL also represses AR-AF1 activity, we transfected COS-1 cells with an AR deletion construct lacking amino acids 654 -919 (AR⌬LBD), which is constitutively active. HEYL could significantly repress the activity of AR⌬LBD on TAT-GRE-E1B-LUC (Fig. 2C) and Probasin-LUC promoter constructs (data not shown). Together, these **data** indicate that HEYL interacts with and represses AR activity largely through AF1. To narrow down the functional domain affected, we next assayed the ability of HEYL to repress AR deletion constructs lacking either TAU1 (AR⌬1) or TAU5 (AR⌬5) (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S3). This showed that deletion of either domain resulted in reduced relative repression of AR activity by HEYL; however, the repression of AR⌬1 (with intact TAU5) by HEYL was proportionately less than that of AR⌬5 (with intact TAU1), indicating that TAU1 (residues 101-360) is likely to be the functional domain that is primarily affected by HEYL in the context of the full-length AR.",no

"To echo this last point, one of the main challenges of metabolomics in plant pathology is distinguishing plant and microbial metabolomes [80]. Metabolites, most particularly primary compounds, are often ubiquitous in the diverse plant, microbial and animal organisms, or exchanged between the host and pathogens, as signals or metabolic responses. In pathological studies (Figure 1), plants and microbes are jointly incubated, but the pathogens are rarely removed before metabolite extraction, thereby mixing metabolomes of different origins. This probably seems to be of minor importance for other omics, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, which exploit species-specific databases. However, metabolomics suffers from cross-contamination of the host and non-host metabolites; therefore, it is often difficult to draw precise conclusions as to the origin of the metabolic variations found. Whilst one can search **data** for metabolites of non-plant origin, for example, arachidonic acid with respect to fungal pathogens, one cannot assume that their absence suggests that metabolites of fungal origin are not being detected. Implementing stable isotope labelling of microbes could address this pressing concern. A recent metabolomics study of the early stage of plant cell-microbe interactions employed an incubation method of 13 C-and 15 N-labelled (98%) Pst DC3000 with Arabidopsis cells, followed by a washing step to remove the excess bacterial cells [169]. Subsequently, ""light"" plant metabolites were analyzed by targeted LC-MS, highlighting an infection reprogramming of plant signaling and primary metabolic pathways, including carbohydrates, nucleotides, and amino and organic acids. Alternatively, uniformly 13 C-and 15 N-labelled plants can be prepared, which will offer an accurate tool for metabolomic analysis under biotic stress conditions [170]. The growing interest in isotopically labelled biological material coincides with the development of additional analytical tools, such as NMR and high-throughput GC-and LC-HRMS, which allow the discrimination between native and labelled metabolites ( Figure 3). It is conceivable that elegant studies of this type will be carried out less sporadically, to help clarify the origin of changes in the host and pathogen metabolome. In summary, future prospects that will greatly contribute to the success of metabolomics in the study of plant immunity will include (i) increasing the capacity to chromatopgraphically resolve and annotate plant and pathogen metabolomes, (ii) new tools and approaches to analyze the metabolome at the subcellular level, and (iii) the development and implementation of modelling, to predict and/or calculate the dynamics of metabolic variations.",no
"DNA methylation is specific, particularly in gene promoter regions, and can be used as cancer marker (15). In the present study, DNA methylation and mRNA expression **data** were retrieved from databases for T2DM and 13 types of cancer and bioinformatics analysis was used to identify key genes associated with differential gene expression and differential methylation. Gene interaction weighted networks were constructed and analyzed using the correlations of methylation levels of these genes, to understand the interactions between genes in an improved way. Ultimately, 8 genes were identified as co-morbid genes for T2DM and cancer. Since the information of different diseases is integrated in our network, the types of cancer involved in comorbid genes and their frequencies, as well as the connectivity values of gene nodes, all reflect the close relationship between T2DM and cancer. The results showed that among these 8 genes, the frequency of CRC was the highest (5/8). Therefore, it is considered that T2DM is more likely to be comorbid with CRC than the other 12 types of cancer, at least in terms of DNA methylation signatures.",no

Considering the distinct physicochemical properties between AgNPs and GO , pathway analysis was further performed for the differentially methylated genes ( Figure 3I , J ) . A multitude of genes were found differentially methylated between AgNPs and GO in both A549 and 293 T cells , including genes responsible for gap junction ( e.g. , LPAR1 and GNAI3 ) [ 24 ] upon AgNPs exposure and genes encoding proteins involved in substance metabolism ( e.g. , PDE5A and GFPT1 ) [ 25 ] upon GO exposure . These differences between AgNPs and GO could be attributed to their distinct physicochemical properties and their different mode of interaction with cells including differential subcellular localization . [ 26][27][28][29 ] For example , AgNP dissolves ions , and Ag ions play a major role in AgNP - induced toxic effects ; [ 26 ] GO have different lateral sizes and surface functional groups and have strong association with biomolecules . [ 27 ] Therefore , we looked into the changes of 5 - mC levels responding to Ag ions and GO with different lateral sizes and surface modifications . Previous studies demonstrated that Ag particles and Ag ions simultaneously existed inside the cells with a release rate of Ag ions around 10 % . [ 28,30 ] Thus , Ag ions at 0.4 µg mL −1 were used to treat cells , and different from Ag particles , Ag ions did not induce a significant change in 5 - mC content in A549 , 293 T , and THP-1 cells ( Figure S14 , Supporting Information ) . In order to answer whether length / size contributes to the influence on DNA methylation induced by ENMs , we deliberately prepared an array of GO with different lateral size , i.e. , S - GO ( smallest ) , I - GO ( intermediate ) , and L - GO ( largest ) , as described in our recent report . [ 28 ] As shown in Figure S18 ( Supporting Information ) , no significant difference could be found among these sized - GO in increasing 5 - mC levels in A549 and 293 T cells . Furthermore , we scrutinized the effect of surface modification on DNA methy lation changes using GO - NH 2 and GO - PEG ( polyethylene glycol coated GO ) , as described in our recent study . [ 31 ] As shown in Figure S19 ( Supporting Information ) , compared with the parental GO and GO - NH 2 , GO - PEG induced a milder increase of 5 - mC levels in A549 and 293 T cells , in agreement with the greater biocompatibility of GO - PEG . [ 31 ] Taken together , these data revealed new insights into the structure - activity relationship for AgNPs and GO : Ag nanoparticles rather than dissolved Ag ions were responsible for the DNA methylation changes ; the surface activity of GO rather than its size played the major role in GO - induced DNA alternations . However , further studies should be considered to identify the physicochemical determinants and nanobio interactions ( e.g. , distinct subcellular localizations ) in inducing different signatures of DNA methylation for diverse ENMs in the future .",no

"In this study, we used the gene expression **data** of Saccharomyces cerevisae or commonly known as yeast from [20]. The original **data** consists of 6,220 gene expression levels taken into 17-time points. The duration of the interval covers two cell cycles of a synchronized sample of yeasts. From the set of monitored genes, 416 of these genes are found to exhibit cell cycle dependent periodicity [3]. The work of Cho et al. [3] also provided a characterization of genes in terms of their involvement in cell cycle regulation. Yeung et al. [25] provided a subset of genes, where no two genes belong to more than one phase. A subset of 384 genes is grouped according to the 5 phases of the cell cycle. Each group corresponds to a specific cell cycle phase which activates in the following order: early G1 phase, late G1 phase, synthesis phase, second growth phase, and mitosis or cell division. In this paper, we refer to the groupings as Group 1 to 5, respectively. We will use the term functional group to refer to the group of genes belonging to a common function. Unless specified otherwise, the main functional grouping of genes is based on the 5 phases of the cell cycle. A more specific grouping was provided in the work of Cho et al.

"Moscow is, no doubt, capable of launching a gray-zone or ambiguous conflict, but Ukraine indicates that it may be unable to control the course of such a war, particularly in the short term. It is impossible to say if Russian leaders will conclude that the attempts at political warfare and irregular warfare in Ukraine were ill-conceived or poorly executed-possibly both. If the purpose was to avoid escalation to a conventional war, then the operation failed. Moscow may conclude that repeating such an operation is too fraught with risk and unpredictability. However, Russia more likely will use the lessons from Ukraine to refine how it goes about political warfare, particularly where use of conventional force is prohibitive.

"It is useful to consider migration to the UK from the perspective of transnationalism, defined as ""the process by which immigrants forge and sustain multi-stranded social relations that link together their societies of origin and settlement"" 37 . From the 1920s until recently, migration research has tended to focus on the incorporation of migrants in their destination country rather than continued ties with their country of origin. However, since the 1990s, ""the transnational turn"" has provided ""a new analytic optic"" 38 . From this perspective, given that migrants maintain ties across the borders of nation-states, return visits to their country of origin and overseas visitors to the UK may result in increased exposure to M.tb. Where **data** was available, 17.2% of TB cases in 2016 in England had travelled outside the UK (excluding Western Europe, US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia) in the two years before diagnosis, and 7.3% had received an overseas visitor. 23.3% of non-UK born cases had travelled outside the UK in 2016 compared with only 4.7% of UK born cases 14 . Such movements are increasing as globalisation leads to the intensification of international interconnectedness: in the UK, travel to visit family and friends abroad increased by 67% between 1998 and 2007 39 . In 2007, UK residents made nearly 900,000 trips to the ISC for the purpose of visiting friends and family 39 .",no

"In this paper, we address these problems by extending the work of Baader and Krcmar [3] in multiple ways: We first extend the requirements for synthetic ERP **data** layed out by Baader et al.

We secondly propose to use an established serious game [9] to simulate not only fraudulent scenarios but also normal operation of a make-to-stock production company through user interaction in a real ERP system, generating both normal and fraudulent behavior simultaneously. Additionally, this allows us to extend the business processes investigated by previous **data** generators from the purchase-to-pay (P2P) process to modeling normal and fraudulent activity in the well established order-to-cash (O2C) process as well. Based on our extended requirements, we then design multiple fraud scenarios in cooperation with auditing experts. We conduct multiple runs of our proposed **data** generation scheme and produce ERP system **data** of multiple fiscal years of operation, extracting raw **data** from the ERP system. The resulting **data** contains many multi-relational tables that offer different views on the recorded company's business process. Since many fraud detection approaches require single tables to operate, we additionally create ready to use datasets from a subset of our multi-relational **data** that can be directly used for measuring and comparing the performance of fraud detection systems. We further extend these datasets by providing expert-created annotations for fraud cases that highlight the problematic entries of individual frauds for use in debugging and assessing performance of algorithms that focus on the detection of anomalous entries specifically.",no

"WCF vs Web API vs NET Remoting. The functionality of the centralized server is exposed as a web-service through Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). There are other ways by which the remote functionality can be exposed such as .Net Remoting of Web API from Microsoft, but neither of them can offer interoperability, security and performance, all in one. Interoperability of the WCF is ensured by the way it publishes it is service and **data** contracts. The WSDL ensures a cross-platform communication, thus adding a high degree of flexibility to this component. Due to its flexibility we can configure the security aspect of the web-service to fit our needs. If configured correctly, the WCF service can ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authorization. Confidentiality and integrity can be guaranteed at transport level or at message level, or at both, without a significant performance penalty. The authorizations in WCF provide flexibility in the way we define the authorizations. New authorizations levels can be defined and configure by the developer, or the WCF service can use the windows accounts that accesses the service. In this case, the developer doesn't have to define the authorization roles, but it needs to configure the levels of authorization. This allows us to write optimized queries the return an optimal amount of data.

"In digital imaging applications, color was first used primarily on CRT displays. The color **data** in most images was adjusted and stored in a device-dependent format suited for providing reasonable reproduction on common CRT monitors. With the proliferation of a large number of other color devices, it is desirable to use a device-independent color specification from which identical-appearing images can be created on multiple output devices. While this has been an active area of research in the industry, a universally acceptable color specification system that guarantees device independence is yet to be defined. The use of standardized colorimetry defines colors in a device-independent space and therefore forms a first step toward achieving device independent color. However, as discussed in Sections II-D and IV-D, the use of a deviceindependent color space does not by itself guarantee an appearance match between images reproduced on different devices under different viewing conditions. Therefore, in addition to colorimetry, the use of auxillary information regarding viewing conditions and white points has been proposed for color specification. Such information would allow exploitation of vision psychophysics and gamut mapping to achieve deviceindependent color [332], [333].",no

"We and others have shown in smooth muscle cells that depletion of cholesterol or silencing of caveolin-1 expression disrupts the organization of membrane caveolae and alters functional responses, as measured by contractile agonist-induced intracellular Ca 2+ release and force generation (Gosens et al., 2007b;Prakash et al., 2007). Our new **data** are consistent with these observations and those showing a role for the actin cytoskeleton in modulating Ca 2+ responses in several other cell types (Calaghan et al., 2004;Rosado et al., 2000;Sabala et al., 2002), because induced changes in ultrastructure and the protein profile of caveolae were associated with a reduction both sensitivity to MCh and in maximum peak [Ca 2+ ] i . Trimeric G-proteins are sequestered to caveolae through the interaction of -subunits with caveolin-1, and the signaling machinery required to mobilize Ca 2+ within smooth muscle cells is organized in caveolae (Darby et al., 2000;de Weerd and Leeb-Lundberg, 1997;Gosens et al., 2007b;Kifor et al., 1998;Li et al., 1995). Although PLC1 is concentrated at the cell membrane, it is also present throughout the cell, whereas G q is more-or-less membrane specific, where it stably associates with PLC1 to allow for rapid transmission of intracellular signals via GPCRs such as the M3 muscarinic receptor (Dowal et al., 2006). Recent evidence suggests that caveolin-1 can have a regulatory role, promoting dissociation of G subunits from  subunits to facilitate GPCR signal transduction (Sengupta et al., 2008). Interaction between caveolin-1 and -dystroglycan appears to be necessary for such a functional role, because in human airway smooth muscle cells with stably silenced -dystroglycan, PLC1 and G q were lost from caveolae and accumulated in fractions that are typically devoid of caveolae. As this change mirrored that for PTRF/cavin and caveolin-1, it suggests that interaction of caveolae with structural proteins and the actin cytoskeleton supports sequestration of signaling molecules for Ca 2+ mobilization, and enable a regulator role for caveolin-1.",no

Angeles et al. (2019) found that unconditional cash transfer (UCT) provision would lead to the recovery of the mental health of young people in Malawi. The fundamental mechanisms were improvement in education, the advisors' condition, and social supports. UCT would break the cycle of poverty and depraved mental health. Giang and Nguyen (2017) tried to examine the relationship between cash transfer and education and health using panel **data** in the Vietnamese Household Living Standard Survey in 2010 and 2012. They found that cash transfer could improve the school participation and had a good impact on poverty. In contrast, cash transfer did not have an effect on either the number of inpatients or the number of outpatients. Handa et al. (2018) found that cash transfer programs of Zambians showed strong productive and protective effects. They argued that this program could improve the long-term living standard and had important roles in improving growth. Sabates et al. (2019) found that cash transfer encouraged investment in education. Unfortunately, since school participation in Rwanda had reached 80%, this program could result in more school participation.",no
"Rio et al explains the structure and organization of the networking code of Linux kernel 2.4.20 [2]. They explain the main **data** structure, the sub-IP layer, the IP layer, and two transport layers: TCP and UDP. This paper contributes our understanding of how the CLNP module can be integrated inside the Linux kernel, just like the IP module integrated in the same Linux kernel.",no
"Another distinctive feature of the SSN regime is the speed of its dynamics , and in particular the speed with which variability is modulated as the stimulus is changed . In contrast to multi - attractor and chaotic dynamics , in which variability modulation happens on timescales that are considerably slower than the single neuron time constant , the SSN produces fast variability modulation on a timescale comparable to the neural time constant . The timescales of variability modulation we extracted from data recorded in monkey visual cortical areas ( Churchland et al . , 2010;Ecker et al . , 2010 ) were fast , on the order of 20 - 50 ms , providing further support to the SSN .",no
"7 Experimental data 7.1 Hippocampal long - term and short - lasting potentiation We reanalysed a dataset obtained from synapses of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells onto CA1 pyramidal cells . A quantal parameter estimation was performed as previously described ( Larkman et al . , 1992 ) . Briefly , this involved quantal parameter estimators similar to the ones given above for evoked responses . We estimated the upper bound from one dataset and tested it in the remaining two ( see Table below ) .",no
"This study has several limitations. First, in contrast to a clinical diagnosis, the CES-D measures past-week depressive symptoms which may vary over time due to the scale's sensitivity to reactions to life events and individual-level cycles of symptomology (Radloff, 1977). However, the CES-D has shown adequate test-retest validity for intervals of up to 12 months (Radloff, 1977) which supports its use in longitudinal studies conducted previously on this topic (Adjibade et al., 2018;Akbaraly et al., 2013;Le Port et al., 2012;Vermeulen et al., 2018). Second, while we included current use of antidepressants in the outcome to indicate depression in the absence of symptoms, there are important limitations to this measure. Some antidepressant medications are prescribed for other conditions like chronic pain and anxiety, and we were unable to distinguish these indications from clinical depression. Additionally, prescribing practices may have changed over time, so **data** on antidepressant use may not reflect the underlying presence of depression in the population. However, antidepressant use has been included in previous studies of the diet-depression relationship (Chocano-Bedoya et al., 2013;Sánchez-Villegas et al., 2015), and our sensitivity analysis that omitted antidepressants from the outcome did not produce materially different results from our primary analysis. Third, the study is limited by two assessments periods, necessitating our assumption that AHEI scores represented the usual diet before and after the baseline assessment.

"The complete automation of smart farming is achieved by ISO 7798-2 security specifica tions-heterogeneous swarms are used in cloud middleware to operate drones, autonomous vehicles, etc. Autonomous-vehicle secure connectivity using IoT devices and key management framework is demonstrated by Jha S. et al. [22]. The vehicular network authentication is performed by blockchain based on hash graphs that can perform thousands of transactions per second and a framework designed using batch rekeying and logical key hierarchy (LKH). The 5G cooperative autonomous connectedness and driving is presented by Bagheri H. et al. [23]. This system uses 5G-based extensive authentication protocol (EAP) supporting 3GPP and non-3GPP communication networks, independent access, and mobility management function with session management function. The autonomous communication within the P2P network is demonstrated by Rahmani L. et al. [24]. A distributed hash table for agent lookup is shared by all the communicating agents and uses public-key cryptography for secure P2P communication with end-to-end encryption. An IoT mutual authentication protocol for Things-To-Things (T2T) is presented by Lounis K. et al. [25]. The T2T protocol uses physical unclonable functions (PUFs) with dual-level-challenge response pairs for the IoT authentication. V2X communication-based efficient authentication for protection against DDOS is demonstrated by Ko T. et al. [26]. The V2X system uses a security credential management system (SCMS), which classifies multiple similar messages in different categories for authentication and uses advanced verify-on-demand (AVoD) for signature verification with threat analysis. An improved isolation forest method for autonomous-vehicles-attack detection is presented by X. Duan et al. [27]. The detection of data-tampering attack is performed here using **data** mass and scoring for anomaly detection as a part of intrusion detection. An autonomous vehicle smart-parking system with the fog-blockchain architecture is presented by Shahzad A. et al. [28]. Smart parking helps to recognize the parking location with the help of fog nodes to IoT, the proof-of-concept by lightweight blockchain and a cryptographic module is utilized. Blockchain-based autonomous vehicle platoon management in 5G is demonstrated by Wu B. et al. [29]. This real-time system improves traffic management with public-key cryptography and 5Genabled revocable attribute-based encryption (RABE) with key distribution and revocation. P2P drone communication using blockchain is presented by Kumar M.S. et al. [30]. The drone base communication uses blockchain with GPS coordinates to avoid spoofing attacks and keeps the blacklisted database.",no
"These literature consider using the causal effect of an intervention on a surrogate outcome (e.g., patients' short-term health) as a proxy for its treatment effect on the outcome of primary interest (e.g., long-term health). To this end, many criteria have been proposed to ensure the validity of the surrogate outcome. Examples include the statistical surrogate criterion [Prentice, 1989], principal surrogate criterion [Frangakis and Rubin, 2002], consistent surrogate criterion [Chen et al., 2007], among many others. However, these criteria can easily run into logic paradox [Chen et al., 2007] or rely on unidentifiable quantities, showing the challenge of causal inference when the primary outcome is completely missing. When multiple surrogates are available, , Price et al. [2018] consider transforming these surrogates to optimally approximate the primary outcome. Their approaches can avoid the surrogate paradox discussed in Chen et al. [2007]. Nevertheless, learning surrogate transformations requires experimental **data** with long-term outcome observations in the first place, which can be very demanding in practice.",no
