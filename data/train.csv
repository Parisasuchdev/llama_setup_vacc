"Unlike most studies that use 2D-DIGE to identify exclusively those proteins that are differentially expressed between different samples, we were also interested in the expression profiles of proteins/isoforms whose abundance did not change significantly (ANOVA, P > 0.01) across the four different TP samples. We therefore employed a second statistical measure of variation, the relative standard deviation (defined as standard deviation divided by arithmetic mean), to assess explicitly the reproducibility of protein abundance measurements. The relative standard deviation was calculated for each protein spot for each of the four TP samples, and the median of these four values was taken as a measure of experimental reproducibility for that spot (see Figure 2c and Table 2 [35]). Comparison of these values with the graphical representation of the raw **data** (see Additional **data** file 1) illustrates the spread of the data. For the 278 proteins/isoforms that do exhibit significant abundance change across the four TP samples and a fold change in excess of 1.4×, the average value of their median relative standard deviations was 11.0%. Interestingly, this value also corresponds to the shoulder of the bimodal distribution of the median relative standard deviations of those Representative two-dimensional DIGE gels of P. falciparum schizont-stage proteins , and in the second dimension on an 11% polyacrylamide gel.

"In spite of the close relationship between phosphorylation and transcriptional regulation, the two networks are generally investigated separately. Many experimental and computational approaches endeavor to disclose the pair-wise interactions of both networks [1] [2] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]. However, integrative studies of the two networks are very limited. A recent study generated a first-generation phosphorylation map for S.cerevisiae, and integrated the phosphorylation results with transcription factor binding **data** [1]. The results demonstrated that the largest class of kinase substrate is transcription factors, and revealed several new regulatory modules. Another study demonstrated in the cell cycle process, cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and transcription factors commonly form feed forward loops to activate different phases of the cell cycle [11]. In these studies, kinase/phosphatase and transcription factor are connected via biochemical interactions. Although such approaches have shed light on the prevalent regulatory motifs in the signaling network, the functional link between these regulators cannot be inferred. In this study, we propose to link kinase/phosphatase and transcription factor by using the transcriptome as an anchor.",Is data availability statement,,0

"To echo this last point, one of the main challenges of metabolomics in plant pathology is distinguishing plant and microbial metabolomes [80]. Metabolites, most particularly primary compounds, are often ubiquitous in the diverse plant, microbial and animal organisms, or exchanged between the host and pathogens, as signals or metabolic responses. In pathological studies (Figure 1), plants and microbes are jointly incubated, but the pathogens are rarely removed before metabolite extraction, thereby mixing metabolomes of different origins. This probably seems to be of minor importance for other omics, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, which exploit species-specific databases. However, metabolomics suffers from cross-contamination of the host and non-host metabolites; therefore, it is often difficult to draw precise conclusions as to the origin of the metabolic variations found. Whilst one can search **data** for metabolites of non-plant origin, for example, arachidonic acid with respect to fungal pathogens, one cannot assume that their absence suggests that metabolites of fungal origin are not being detected. Implementing stable isotope labelling of microbes could address this pressing concern. A recent metabolomics study of the early stage of plant cell-microbe interactions employed an incubation method of 13 C-and 15 N-labelled (98%) Pst DC3000 with Arabidopsis cells, followed by a washing step to remove the excess bacterial cells [169]. Subsequently, ""light"" plant metabolites were analyzed by targeted LC-MS, highlighting an infection reprogramming of plant signaling and primary metabolic pathways, including carbohydrates, nucleotides, and amino and organic acids. Alternatively, uniformly 13 C-and 15 N-labelled plants can be prepared, which will offer an accurate tool for metabolomic analysis under biotic stress conditions [170]. The growing interest in isotopically labelled biological material coincides with the development of additional analytical tools, such as NMR and high-throughput GC-and LC-HRMS, which allow the discrimination between native and labelled metabolites ( Figure 3). It is conceivable that elegant studies of this type will be carried out less sporadically, to help clarify the origin of changes in the host and pathogen metabolome. In summary, future prospects that will greatly contribute to the success of metabolomics in the study of plant immunity will include (i) increasing the capacity to chromatopgraphically resolve and annotate plant and pathogen metabolomes, (ii) new tools and approaches to analyze the metabolome at the subcellular level, and (iii) the development and implementation of modelling, to predict and/or calculate the dynamics of metabolic variations.",Is data availability statement,,0
"Secondly , given the genetic overlap between traits , we observed that some signals were shared between sex hormone traits but appeared to have much stronger effects in one versus others . To help derive additional genetic risk scores that reflected this , we took all genome - wide significant signals within each sex but across traits , and performed ward - based hierarchical clustering 35 on individual variant Z scores . We used the observed clusters from these analyses to produce additional genetic instruments ( Supplementary Table 16 ): 8 .

"Our work is consistent with that of others demonstrating that neuronal uptake of tau seeds occurs in a clathrin-independent, but dynamin1-and actin-dependent mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time the critical involvement of Rac1 in this process. The use of pharmacological and genetic approaches in neuronal uptake and seeding assays shows the relevance of this pathway in tau spreading pathology further strengthening findings by other groups. While we previously suggested CME in the neuronal uptake of Tau because of the demonstrated role of Bin1 (14), our current **data** prove that unequivocally clathrin does not play a role. Selectively inhibiting downstream effectors of Rac1 involved in actin polymerization and endocytosis, including Arp2/3, N-WASP, and PAK1, did not reduce tau seeds internalization. As mentioned before, clathrin-independent, dynamin-dependent endocytosis as well as macropinocytosis has been proposed previously as a mechanism by which tau aggregates are internalized by cell lines (16,17) or human neurons (18). The **data** presented here show that also in neurons, several proteins that are part of the core machineries involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis or macropinocytosis, such as dynamin1, actin, and Rac1, are involved in the uptake of Tau seeds. However, molecular players functioning in macropinocytosis, like PAK1, could not be linked to tau seeds uptake (58,59). Therefore, we conclude that the uptake of tau seeds by neurons is carried out by a distinct endocytosis mechanism that is dependent on dynamin and Rac1 and independent of clathrin.",Is data availability statement,,0

"Theorem 4 .
4Consider the following commutative diagram. Then π N (H) : M H → M H /N (H) is a bundle reduction of π : M → M/G and π ′ : M H → M H /(N (H)/H) is a principal bundle reduction of M H → M H /N (H). There is a one-to-one correspondence between principal bundle connections on M H → M H /(N (H)/H) and singular connections on M . Furthermore, the curvature form for the singular connection restricted to M H is equal to the curvature form Ω of the principal connection. Proof. As we have already remarked, every G-orbit in M intersects M H in a unique N (H)-orbit. Therefore for m ∈ M H , π N (H) (m) = π(ι(m)), and then M/G ≃ M H /N (H). Furthermore, since H fixes every point of M H , the free action of N (H)/H on M H has the same orbits as the action of N (H) on M H and therefore the bundle M H → M H /(N (H)/H) is a principal bundle reduction of M H → M H /N (H). To set up the one-to-one correspondence of connections, we start with a connection on the principal bundle π ′ : M H → M H /(N (H)/H). Denote this connection by Γ consisting of horizontal spaces Q m for each m ∈ M H and its connection form by ω : T M H → n/h. We show how to induce from this **data** a connection on M → M/G where the connection **data** will consist of a horizontal distribution invariant with respect to the group action.

"Corrected Proof two-day, once in 10 year rainfall **data** were used. As there is no backwater effect, water flows through the canals by gravity. The drainage capacity of the Pungi canal is insufficient in some places, which contributes to flooding in a number of areas. The drainage capacity of the Kerunga canal is sufficient to carry the storm water it receives and hence no flooding occurs in the Kerunga canal catchment. The simulated inundated area is around 166 ha, which falls mainly in the Pungi canal catchment under this scenario (Figure 14). canals and the construction of some new drains in the Pungi canal system were incorporated into scenario Sc-2. The bottom level of the canal becomes silted up in some places, or the channel sections become narrow due to encroachment. While designing the section, a gentle slope is maintained along the canal and widened at places where necessary. These improvement works would increase the canal's water-carrying capacity and would make 94 ha land free of waterlogging in the Pungi catchment area, and the simulated inundated area would be about 72 ha (Figure 14).

"We correct for leading-track misidentification with a data-driven procedure.

Since the tracking inefficiency is quite small (about 20%) applying it on the reconstructed **data** a second time does not alter the results significantly. To verify this statement we compared our results with a two step procedure. In this case the inefficiency is applied two times on measured data, half of its value at a time.

Furthermore, the data-driven procedure has been tested on simulated **data** where the true leading particle is known.

Plus, in meiosis and mitosis, Sok2 associates with Msn2/4, and they are co-regulated in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase signal transduction pathway [23].

"With regard to clinical significance, we conclude that the change scores found in our study (mean difference LSP at 12 months: 6,1 for CAT and 1,5 for TAU; group difference LSP at 12 months: 3,8 based on the multilevel model) are consistent with previous studies on rehabilitative interventions in this population (4 points in 12 months 45 and 6 points in 18 months 46 ). The follow-up effect for the LSP is consistent with our hypothesis that with CAT as a nursing intervention, we would be able to maintain functional improvements when the intervention is continued. That is, we expected that nurses would internalize the CAT method and continue to provide CAT to the people in their caseload.

"Generating the sequence using a preferential attachment based model . We apply a preferential attachment based model to generated topic tuple sequences with power - law distributed usage of each topic tuple [ 32,37,38 ] . In the model , an individual 's activity is randomly chosen from the two actions . One is to explore a new subject and publish a paper with a new topic tuple . The other is to return to a previously studied subject and publish a paper with a topic tuple already used . The probability to explore is defined as ρn −γ in which the term n −γ captures the decreasing trend to explore a new subject as the number of papers increases . Consequently the probability of return , i.e. to reuse an old topic tuple , is 1 − ρn −γ . If one returns , the choice of existing topic tuples is governed by preferential attachment : the probability p i to use a specific topic tuple i is proportional to the tuple i 's current usage , so p i = n i / j n j where n i is the number of times that the tuple i is used . The parameters applied are ρ = 0.4 and γ = 0.1 . Each individual 's time step is controlled by the number of papers published , following distribution P ( n ) ∼ n −1.5 with a cutoff n max = 150 .

"Olivetti et al . [ 57 ] synthesized the available data on consumption rates relative to available reserves for nickel ( Ni ) , manganese ( Mn ) , cobalt ( Co ) , lithium , ( Li ) , and natural graphite . They found that the ratio of known reserves to primary mine production ( also known as the static depletion index ) has increased for Co , Li , and natural graphite , suggesting that continued demand has resulted in additional exploration and extraction . Mn and Ni did not show an upward or downward trend , indicating that the ratio of production to known reserves has remained relatively constant . This highlights the challenge of attempting to place a single number on finite resource depletion as part of an LCA ; society 's understanding of available resources is not static . Increased demand drives advancements in exploration and recovery technologies . Material recovery potential through   recycling adds another layer of complexity . As Olivetti et al . [ 57 ] rightly point out , there is a time lag between when batteries are manufactured and when they reach the end of their life , so regardless of what can be recovered , recycling is unlikely to address any near - term ( 10 - 20 year ) material supply constraints . If battery technologies do not evolve away from reliance on these critical materials in coming decades , recycling can be an important long - term strategy . Pyrometallurgical recycling facilities will recover Ni , Co , Mn , and Copper ( Cu ) , [ 58 ] while hydrometallurgical recycling facilities will recover all of the aforementioned metals , as well as Li and aluminum ( Al ) . Direct recycling will recover an even larger range of materials , many of which can be reused without further processing . Given this context , it is worth revisiting the assertion by Peters et al . [ 11 ] that abiotic depletion ( an impact category representing depletion of non - renewable resources , such as minerals and fossil fuels ) is the most important impact of batteries on a normalized basis , exceeding the importance of GWP . Many of the nuances in critical material use and supply outlooks are lost in typical LCA practices and reducing these impacts to a single score is more likely to create confusion than generate useful insights , particularly when fossil fuel and critical material depletion are combined in a single score . This is particularly true for materials like Co and Li , for which demand is growing rapidly . In fact , a greater cause for concern is the geographic diversification , or lack thereof , in reserves and supply for some of these materials .",Is data availability statement,,0
"After witnessing the eclipse in La Serena on July 2nd, 2019, we were interested in finding out how much the atmosphere's surface layer had cooled during the event. Observers reported that they felt colder during the eclipse than before, but that does not necessarily imply that the air temperature dropped considerably, since much of the sensation may be due to an experienced reduction in direct radiative heating of the body. CEAZAMet operates a monitoring network with many stations inside the belt of totality of this eclipse which provided us with near-surface air temperature data. However, no 'obvious' pattern of change, such as a pronounced dip in the temperature curve, is consistently discernible at all or a majority of the stations.

"Comparison with Sample-wise AT. Previous works (Hendrycks et al. 2021;Yi et al. 2021) try to exploit samplewise AT as a **data** augmentation strategy to obtain higher OOD performance. However, the performance only improves when the distribution shift is dominated by diversity shift, e.g., noise, and blurring. Otherwise, performance might be degraded, as shown in Table 1. One possible explanation is that sample-wise AT fails to capture the domain-level variations as DAT. As a result, it may add perturbations to the invariant features and hurt performance, especially under correlation shift.",Is data availability statement,,0

"showing that in this limit the numerics are under control . For the rescaled equation ( eq.14 ) we can study the lowest mass meson as a function of the quark mass . Figure 3 shows the value of the first meson mass as a function of the quark mass . The important point to note here is that there appears to be a mass gap in the m → 0 limit for l = 0 . The numerics make this calculation difficult , though at m = 10 −10 the value of M 1 is 0.28 . Note that in contrast to the equation of motion with l = 0 , the D7 - brane equation is perfectly well behaved in this limit and has discrete eigenvalues . This will be shown analytically in section 4.2 . The scale is set by the AdS radius R which can be tuned by hand to compare with lattice data .",Is data availability statement,,0

"Although all of these LEP2 and Tevatron measurements are in agreement with Standard Model predictions, it is generally considered that should non-Standard Model physics play a role in this process, its effects will be manifest greater at greater energy scales. In particular, the effects of anomalous W W γ and W W Z triple gauge boson couplings, are predicted to grow with the invariant mass of the gauge boson pair [16]. Thus, even though fewer events will be recorded, the high energy **data** still being accumulated by CDF and D0 combined, has the potential to surpass the sensitivity of the LEP2 **data** to such effects. At the LHC the inclusive cross section for vector boson pair production is around a factor of ten higher than at the Tevatron, moreover, the luminosity is also substantially higher. It is then expected that in the near future very large quantities of high energy weak boson pairs will be recorded by the LHC experiments and that the non-Abelian nature of the weak bosons will be tested with a new level of vigor. To facilitate such precision tests theoretical predictions, ideally in the form of fully exclusive Monte Carlo simulations, should be made as accurate as possible.",Is data availability statement,,0
"Compared with increasing coverage , partner notification identifies more chlamydia positive individuals for each unit of resource invested in a screening programme . There is considerable scope to improve partner notification outcomes . Furthermore , reallocation of resources to ensure provision and monitoring of effective partner notification is likely to result in substantial cost savings in comparison with increasing screening coverage only . It is not clear from the available data how much additional benefit should be expected from a given level of investment in partner notification . The wide range of reported partner notification and the diverse methods of organisation make it difficult to generalise , and urgent evaluation is needed to establish the most cost effective approach to partner notification . Equitable access to screening for men and women should continue to be promoted . However , the additional resources required to increase male screening coverage to reach equity with females would be more effectively employed in the short term in achieving high partner notification efficacy among those who test positive . Partner notification therefore mitigates the impact of sex inequity in screening coverage since the high proportion of partners infected offsets the lower number of men screened Performance indicators must reflect quality and value for money of service provision , not just quantity of services provided . The spreadsheet tool we have developed will enable local services to evaluate their own programmes and allow rapid updates based on national reports . This tool could also be adapted for use in other countries . We provide strong evidence for the cost effectiveness of partner notification in identifying infected cases compared with screening alone . The number of infected individuals ( women and men ) identified through a screening programme is arguably a more appropriate metric for assessing the success of screening than primary coverage by sex .",Is data availability statement,,0

"Illumina's HumanHT-12 v4 BeadArrays were used to generate expression profiles of more than 48,000 probes using 500 ng of labeled cRNA for each sample following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. All expression **data** are available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the series number GSE35007. The individual expression arrays are listed as GSM860207 through GSM860517. To minimize chip and batch effects, a randomized design was used. Hybridization was performed on two different dates and 4 samples from the first hybridization batch were re-hybridized with the second batch. These technical replicates clustered adjacent to one another in hierarchical analysis, indicating a negligible batch effect on the data. This was confirmed by testing for batch effect in the probe-by-probe analysis of variance. The expression intensities were averaged for each probe in the statistical analysis. The raw intensities were extracted using the Gene Expression Module in Illumina's BeadStudio software. Expression intensities were log2 transformed and quantile normalized using JMP Genomics v5.0 (SAS) after an outlier filtering procedure was applied. In total, 28,595 probes with expression at or above background levels averaged across all the arrays were retained for further analyses. These represent probes remaining after removal of 18,404 probe measurements that were considered to lay below background detection levels indicated by the inflection point in a plot of rank-ordered normalized intensities. Also, 427 probes overlaying SNPs included in the Illumina's OmniExpress BeadChip were removed from the analysis.

It is impossible to say if Russian leaders will conclude that the attempts at political warfare and irregular warfare in Ukraine were ill-conceived or poorly executed-possibly both. If the purpose was to avoid escalation to a conventional war, then the operation failed. Moscow may conclude that repeating such an operation is too fraught with risk and unpredictability.

"To compare our findings to observations , we extract the following characteristics from the computed spectra : ( i ) the ratio of the integrated redward over the integrated blueward flux ( L red /L blue ) -which is a measure of the asymmetry of the line shape ; ( ii ) the flux at ' draught ' between the peaks ( F valley ) in comparison to the flux at the maximum point ( F peak ) , which , in practice , quantifies the ' deepness ' of the draught of the double peaked spectra ; and ( iii ) the position of the red emission peak ( v red ) . We show the evolution of these measures in Fig . 3 from t = 40 to 100 Myr ( in intervals of 10 Myr ) with the last data point marked with a square . We compare this to observations of nearby , star - forming galaxies ( the ' Green Peas ' ; data taken from Yang et al . 2016 , also Henry et al . 2015 , and to z ∼ 2 − 3 Lyman - α selected galaxies ( Erb et al . 2014 ) . In addition , we also display other simulation results presented in Walch et al . ( 2015 ) , Gatto et al . ( 2017 ) , and Peters et al . ( 2017 ) ( shown as black circles in Fig . 3 ) . These hydrodynamical simulations include supernovae feedback with random SN positions and cover SN rates from 5 to 45 Myr −1 with none including CRs ( but partially include stellar wind and UV feedback ) . We show them only to support the case that the spectral shape we obtain for the ' noCR ' simulation is not an outlier -but in fact typical for hydrodynamical simulations containing thermal feedback . Fig . 3 shows that all the simulations without CRs produce Lyα spectra with significant flux at line center ( F valley 0.4F peak ; see also the left panel of Fig . 1 ) . This flux is reduced significantly from t 30 Myr in the CR simulations as the outflow is established . Also the asymmetry of the line is increased leading to L red /L blue ∼ 2 . Both measures are more in line with what is found in observations where mostly F valley /F peak 0.1 and L red /L blue 2.5 ( see also Steidel et al . 2010;Kulas et al . 2012 ) . Determining F valley observationally requires a high spectral resolution since the convolution of the true spectrum with the instrument 's kernel leads to a spreading of the peak flux , and thus , the true value of F valley can be even lower than measured . This effect makes our comparison of F valley /F peak conservative and the true discrepancy between the ' noCR ' simulation and the observations might be even larger .",Is data availability statement,,1

"With the increasing use of digital imagery that is independent of TV, new methods are continually being introduced. Just as in halftoning, coding schemes that exploit the lowpass spatial response of the eye have been suggested for image coding. In subband coding [313], the image is split into orthogonal subbands with varying frequency content. The subbands are then quantized with fewer bits allocated to higher frequency components. VQ techniques, similar to those described in the earlier section on palettization, can be used for the quantization. Known anisotropy in the eye's spatial response can also be utilized. The lower sensitivity of the eye along the 45 angle, permits fewer bits to be allocated to frequency bands located on the diagonal. This idea is easily extended to color images. However, complete **data** on the spatial frequency response of the eye to spatial color (chromatic) frequencies has only recently been published.

There was no evidence of an effect of self medication as pre - existing psychotic symptoms did not significantly predict later cannabis use . 6 Ferdinand and co - workers investigated the role of pre - existing self reported psychotic symptoms and showed a bi - directional association between cannabis and psychotic symptoms over a 14 year follow - up study in the general population . 11 They showed that cannabis use predicted later psychotic symptoms in individuals with no evidence of psychotic symptoms before starting to use cannabis and that the reverse was also true , in that psychotic symptoms predicted cannabis use in those who had not used cannabis before the onset of those symptoms . 11 A prospective population based cohort study also found evidence for a self medication effect . 14 Individuals with self reported hallucinations at the age of 14 had a higher risk of using cannabis on a daily basis at the age of 21 .

"The findings from this systematic review highlight that EPA and DHA have differential effects on some cardiometabolic risk factors and that, to some degree, this effect is dependent on the study population. Both EPA and DHA are effective at lowering triglycerides, although there is evidence that DHA may lower triglycerides more than EPA. Whilst neither omega-3 PUFA alters total cholesterol to a great degree, DHA appears to increase HDL cholesterol, particularly the more cardioprotective HDL 2 subfraction, whilst EPA decreases HDL 3 cholesterol. DHA increases LDL cholesterol more than EPA, and more so in men than in women, and also increases LDL particle size, which may be less atherogenic. From the more limited trial **data** available, DHA may be more effective than EPA at lowering heart rate and blood pressure in normotensive individuals, whilst both EPA and DHA inhibited platelet function but had no effect on fibrinolytic function. Whilst inconsistent findings were reported for the effects of EPA and DHA on inflammatory markers and glycaemic control, both omega-3 PUFAs were able to lower oxidative stress, which is increased in certain subjects such as diabetics thereby increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease.",Is data availability statement,,1

The surface cover materials we consider are: glycerol, propylene carbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyvinylindene flouride (PVDF), perflouropolyether (PFPE), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). PMMA, PVDF, PFPE, glycerol, and PC have been commonly used in experimental work [48][49][50][51][52]. PMMA and PVDF are both solids, while all the others are liquid at room temperature. We analyze the noise spectra at frequencies ranging from 1 kHz − 10 MHz, typical in experiments, and compare the results with experimental **data** of Ref. [32].",Is data availability statement,,0
"EBL cells after M. bovis treatment with 50 MOI were collected for total RNA extraction and transcriptome analysis. In brief, cellular total RNAs were isolated using the Trizol reagent (Takara, Dalian, China). Qualified total RNA was further purified by an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, GmBH, Hilden, Germany). The mRNAs were enriched using the Oligo(dT) beads and then were fragmented and reverse transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA Library quality was checked using a Bioanalyzer2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The cDNAs were purified with QiaQuick PCR extraction kit (Qiagen, GmBH, Germany), end repaired, poly(A) added and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. The ligation products were size selected by agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR amplified and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 by Gene Denovo Biotechnology (Guangzhou, China).

"Merely all the error models previously identified can be applied for human error analysis. Common errors are the occurrence of an action of the actor not belonging to the planned interaction (error E.1), the execution of actions in a wrong order (E.2), and the omission of an action during an interaction (E.3). It is also possible to note human errors such as E.6, E.7 and E.8 consisting in furnishing bad **data** to the system. For instance, a user can type a letter whereas the system is waiting for a number (E.6), or he/she can tune a pressure valve too high for the system (E.8). The error E.4 is rather rare in human error analysis because it implies that the object for the interface is absent. The error E.5 depends on the time constraints a system can have, and is based on non functional requirements as for the error E.10. The error model E.9 which concerns response of a message (return values) is really useful for software or electronic components analysis. In case of the human component this is equal to E.6, E.7 and E.8, for message coming from the system.",Is data availability statement,,0
"Crucially, then, recognising the interpretive nature of material evidence and the subsequent construction and use of interpretive **data** would contribute to more rigorous theory building and causal explanation in archaeology. Structuring evidence accordingly provides concepts to work to in the middle range of 'empirical theory' and consequently to construct better arguments on the basis of analysing this evidence (sensu Smith 2011Smith , 2015Ellen 2010). Nicholas and Markey (2015: 287) formulate the questions well: 'how do we know what we know about the archaeological record; and what types of evidence suffice for providing adequate ""proof"" for our interpretations?'

"Fine epitope mapping using yeast display. The anti-HCV core antigen MAb has been mapped to aa 32 to 36, the anti-HCV NS4 MAb to aa 1697 to 1708, the HCV NS3 cAb to aa 1190 to 1216, and the HCV NS5 cAb to aa 2382 to 2408. To fine map the epitopes, alanine scanning combined with yeast display was used to probe the epitopes at the individual amino acid level. Each amino acid of the epitope fragment was substituted with alanine. For example, HCV NS5 aa 2382 to aa VOL. 17,2010 cAbs AGAINST HCV NS3, NS4, NS5, AND CORE ANTIGENS 1043 2408 had alanine substituted at each position of the epitope, with the exclusion of aa 2382, which was alanine in the wild type.

"These **data** suggested that RprY may play a role in regulating the heat shock response in P. gingivalis. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to determine whether the regulation was due to direct binding of RprY to the promoter regions of the genes in question or an indirect effect because of RprY interaction with another regulator. DNA probes were generated by amplification of the 59 intergenic region upstream of the ORFs. DIG-labeled probes were incubated with increasing amount of phosphorylated rRprY protein (,0, 8.8, 17.6 and 35.2 pmol). Protein binding specificity was determined by adding 50-100X excess unlabeled probe to the reaction mixes. In these experiments the ahpC and sod promoters were used as positive and negative controls, respectively, as we previously showed that ahpC, but not sod, was a target of RprY [9]. By EMSA we showed that RprY bound to the promoter regions of groES, clpB and dnaK, but did not bind to the promoter region of htpG (Fig. 6B).",Is data availability statement,,0
"We have successfully implemented online 4D dose reconstruction in our research treatment planning and delivery platform. The tracking solution can be used on a conventional linac. The tracking and delivery software DynaTrack runs on a computer in the linac control room, while the workstation running DynaPlan can be placed anywhere, as long as a lowlatency network connection is available. The algorithms for dose calculation and accumulation reach a high memory bandwidth of 50-70 GB/s on the workstation used in this study. Although the runtimes are reasonably stable, Windows is not a real-time operating system. Hence there might always be an unexpected lag, resulting in individual outlier runtimes for a few scattered instances. The mean computation time per MLC aperture ranged from 21.3 to 34.5 ms which was well below 40 ms. Hence, a computation rate of 25 Hz can be maintained. If latency builds up nonetheless, it can be compensated during beam-off periods, when no accumulation has to be performed. For the patient **data** in this study, the runtimes scale with the size of the dose-influence data. On computers with less memory bandwidth or computational power, the number of slices to calculate and accumulate dose for could be decreased (e.g., to the target region-of-interest only, instead of the whole lung volume).",Is data availability statement,,0

"Sweet potato cv. Xushu 18 was used in this study. Plants were grown on test field under natural conditions in May of 2009 at Sichuan University. For 2-DE analysis, we harvested the unexpanded young leaves and the fully expanded mature leaves ( Supplementary Fig. S1) at midday and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. For cloning of the two RCA isoform genes, the fully expanded leaves of sweet potato were collected. To investigate whether mRNA's expressed pattern of Ib-RCA in leaf tissue is regulated by light, we harvested mature leaves every 2 h throughout a 24 h period. In order to investigate the temperature responses of Ib-RCA genes, sweet potato growing in field was transplanted to climate box (25°C under a 14/10 h light/dark photoperiod and 200 lEm -2 s -1 ).

"Our **data** thus far clearly point to PIKfyve playing a role in the process of tau seeding in neurons. In order to explore this, we decided to further characterize K18 PFFs uptake and internalization following PIKfyve inhibition. Using K18 PFFs labeled with the pH-insensitive AF488, the number of K18 or FL Tau PFF-positive vesicles in primary hippocampal neurons was to our surprise not altered at 100 nM or 1 μM YM-201636 treatment (Fig. 5, A and B). These results seemed at first to be counterintuitive given our previous **data** using pHrodo labeled K18 PFFs that suggested reduced internalization. To address this conundrum, we tested if pharmacological inhibition of PIKfyve would reduce K18-pHrodo signal as we observed using the knockdown approach. Similar to PIKfyve knock-down, treatment of primary hippocampal neurons with YM-201636 displayed a dose-dependent reduction in K18-pHrodo signal (Fig. 5, C and D). Since the pHrodo signal is not only dependent on neuronal internalization of a labeled substrate but also on the transport into low-pH compartments, we evaluated intracellular acidification using LysoTracker. Interestingly, YM-201636 treatment did not show a decrease, but rather an increase in LysoTracker intensity at concentrations up to 1 μM before reducing due to toxicity (Fig. 5F). These **data** show that the reduction in K18-pHrodo signal is not due to impaired acidification but instead suggest that K18 PFFs are retained in nonacidic vesicles in the endosomal pathway. In support of this notion, PIKfyve inhibition has been linked to an intracellular vesicular phenotype consisting in enlarged endosomes, caused by the reduced maturation of MVB into lysosomes as well as lysosomal recycling (52,53). Indeed, when we treated primary hippocampal neurons with 1 μM YM-201636, we noticed a decrease in the number of LAMP1-positive organelles but an increase in their size, supported by 3D imaging and in line with previous reports (54, 55) (Figs. 5E and S8). Similar findings can be observed in HEK293T cells following 30 min treatment with 1 μM YM-201636, pointing to a cell-typeindependent phenotype (Fig. S9). These **data** suggest that the reduction in K18 PFFs internalization previously seen with Rac1 inhibition is carried out by a mechanism that is PIKfyveindependent, while PIKfyve could be important for the fate of the seed once internalized.",Is data availability statement,,0

"The provinces in the CW-regions in China are relatively underdeveloped and have a strong desire for economic development, but they have also recognized their more fragile ecological environment and thus put forward green development strategies. This paper proposes that the CW-regions in China have the backwardness advantage of green development, which is of great significance for these regions to achieve the dual goals of economic catch-up and environmental protection. The conclusions form a useful supplement to the theory of sustainable development and the theory of backwardness advantage have important theoretical significance for solving the contradiction between economic catch-up and environmental pollution in underdeveloped regions and have important practical significance for the current economic reform of China, as well as important significance for the economic transformation and sustainable development in other developing countries. This paper finds that the CW-regions have comparative advantages in human capital, and the gap in GTP with the E-region is significantly lower than the gap in technological progress.
